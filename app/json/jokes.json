  "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.": [
    "Good afternoon, everybody.  Last night Michelle Smith and I attended the swearing in of Tim Geithner by Vice President Biden, with President Obama in attendance. So we now have a new Treasury Secretary.  There will be a dinner tonight after the meeting at which we will honor Tim and say good-bye from this post as he goes into another.  This is a new year and new things, and so this morning the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced their new PresidentBill Dudley. Congratulations, Bill.  You made it all the way \nacross the table.",
    "As you know, Governor Kroszner resigned in anticipation of the appointment of the new Governor, Dan Tarullo.  But Dan has not yet cleared the Senate, so obviously he wont be attending the meeting, which leaves the Governors here as an embattled few,",
    "Without objection.  Thank you.  All right. Now we go on to item 3, selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to operate the SOMA.  In a shocking development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has again expressed willingness to serve in this capacity.",
    "I am going to regret this, but I am going to ask you a question.",
    "I certainly agree that you cannot trust academics.",
    "Why dont we reconvene.  I can start by offering a summary of the discussion around the table, which was informative as always but fairly uniform this time.  The intermeeting data, as we have seen, indicate a very sharp contraction, both domestically and abroad, which reflects in large part the effects of the intensification of the financial crisis but also the increasingly powerful feedback loop from the economy to financial conditions. Many people noted that the financial conditions remain very fragile.  Consumption, employment, and production indicators suggest that the pronounced contraction in activity in the fourth quarter is likely to continue through the first part of 2009.  Participants noted that the slowdown is very widespread across sectors. Some participants expect a return to positive economic growth later this year, citing such factors as fiscal policy, lower oil prices, inventory adjustments, government efforts to stabilize the financial sector, and the possibility of improving confidence. However, uncertainty remains high, and risks are to the downside as sentiment is \n currently very depressed. Moreover, based on experiences with other financial crises, the possibility of a protracted slump or L-shaped recovery remains significant. Some financial markets, including markets that have received Fed support, such as the money and mortgage markets, have shown modest signs of improvement.  However, bank losses for the fourth quarter were greater than markets anticipated, and many institutions remain under substantial stress. Bank loans are declining with tighter terms, falling credit demand, and a lack of creditworthy borrowers. Very tight credit conditions are, in turn, affecting both households and firms.  Declining asset values are also affecting wealth and confidence, including declines in defined-contribution pension plans.  Whether the new government initiatives to stabilize banking are successful will be an important factor in the outlook. Consumers continue to retrench, cutting back as balance sheets are repaired and precautionary saving rises in an uncertain environment.  Employment declines have been large, with firms projecting further job cuts ahead, and there are wage and salary freezes occurring.  Fiscal stimulus could also provide a boost to consumer income and support state and local spending, which is currently contracted. There has been little indication of stabilization in the housing sector as house prices and building activity continue to decline.  Nonresidential construction is likely to fall as financing dries up and fundamentals weaken.  A number of participants expressed concern that commercial real estate could follow the path of residential real estate. Other investment has also contracted in light of prevailing uncertainties, including uncertainties about government policy, tight credit, and low capacity utilization.  Lower commodity prices have affected drilling and mining activity and to a lesser extent agriculture.  Exports and imports have both fallen sharply, reflecting both domestic and global slowdowns and possibly lessened availability of trade finance. \n  Inflation has fallen significantly and looks likely to be low in the medium term.  There is some risk that inflation could fall below levels consistent with good economic performance, and some expressed concern about a deflationary trap possibly at the global level.  However, maintaining stable inflation expectations remains very important.  Currently there appears to be quite a bit of diversity in the publics inflation expectations, including concerns about both deflationary and inflationary outcomes.  That is just a summary of comments I heard.   I do not have a great deal to add on my own. Let me make just a few remarks.  Obviously, I share with everyone the observation that activity has fallen very rapidly, perhaps not much more quickly than expected at our last meeting but still confirming the very substantial effects of the financial crisis and the overall tightening in the credit markets.  A somewhat bigger surprise is the decline in global economies, which has been more severe than anticipated.  On a global basis, this seems very likely to be the worst postwar recession, and the global declines will make it more difficult for the U.S. economy to recover. As others have noted, there have been some marginal improvements in a few financial markets, and the Feds programs, at least in those markets, seem to have had some benefits.  We have seen a little improvement in corporate bond markets as well.  The most important news on \nthe financial side since the last meeting, though, has been the worse-than-expected results in the banking system, the fact that we have had to go back and address instability in two of our largest \nfour banking organizations, despite the large injections of TARP capital.  It is indicative of the tremendous concerns about the stability of the banking system.  The continuing credit losses pose a real challenge both to the banking system and to efforts by the government and the \nTreasury to restore stability. \n  My general view is that, although fiscal policy could be helpful and will probably provide some impetus later this year and next year, we may see something similar to what we saw in the spring, which was a temporary boost and then very little sustained recovery unless we can get substantial improvement in the banking situation.  I share the same uncertainties about the prospects of recovery or at least the beginning of positive economic growth later this year that \nothers have. The Greenbook case relies fairly heavily on inventory dynamics.  Currently inventory liquidation is subtracting from growth, and so stabilizing final sales at zero by midyear, which seems like an easy task, would be sufficient to give us some positive growth.  That said, it is probably not such an easy thing to ensure that final sales stabilize.  We should expect to see continued declines in investment and in trade.  We may see some growth in government, obviously with the fiscal programs; but even so, to get to zero growth in final sales, the Greenbook needs to forecast growth of about 2 percent in real consumption in the second half of the year, which given current developments may not be so easy to obtain.  So like many of you, I guess that we will see a stabilization, perhaps some modest positive growth, in the latter part of this year, but this is by no means a certainty.  It will depend very substantially and perhaps most fundamentally on achieving some stabilization in the banking sector.  I dont think that other financial improvements will compensate for continued deterioration in bank balance \nsheets. The next intermeeting period will be very important.  It is of great significance that we have now made it through the political transition period.  I think it did create additional uncertainty. It is interesting that the implications of the March inauguration in 1933 were the reason we pushed it back to January, and we may make it November 5 next time.",
    "That is also factually correct.",
    "Lets go through that again. PARTICIPANT. But only marginally.",
    "Well, I was diagramming that sentence.",
    "Well, as simplified by President Lacker, it was is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective.  I think thats three subjunctives.",
    "Okay. So I hear a slight preference forokay, Brian suggests that the economy has weakened further. All right. The last question, then, is whether or not to add or replace B3 with A3.  That would add the sentence that the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability.  I propose to take a straw vote of all of the participantsnot just members but participants.  All those in favor of making the change?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  All opposed?  One, two, three, four, five, six. All right. I think it is a reasonable change.  I dont think it is dramatic.  Any other comments? \n All right. I guess we have made three changes now.  I propose alternative B. I think it conveys the sense of the Committee.  It maintains, as much as possible, our optionality while suggesting that we are going to be aggressive.  Again, we will be looking both to the Treasury and to the government for their actions over the next intermeeting period.  Once again, I invite members and other participants to submit their suggestions for communication and measurement over the intermeeting period. I probably should mention that there will be opportunities for us to communicate about our views further. In particular, I have a testimony on February 10 on our transparency and our communication. I have a speech at the National Press Club, which will have more of a press conference type of flavor, sort of between a speech and a press conference, on February 18.  Then, I have the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings, followed by Budget Committee hearings, so you will be seeing a lot of me on television.  My complexion is not usually green but probably will be \nby then.",
    "Is that a widespread view?  All right. We will investigate.  We will make sure that it works with peoples schedules and see if it is feasible.  But I agree that \n it would be very difficult to do what we did in this meeting in one day.  Other comments or feedback? All right. Hearing none, the next meeting is Tuesday, March 17.  Thats St. Patricks Day, isnt it? Very nice.",
    "Id like to point out Governor Tarullo has a 14-year term.",
    "Good afternoon and happy St. Patricks Day, everybody.  Id like to start by welcoming Governor Tarullo to his first non-video",
    "Without objection.  The first item on the agenda is Desk operations and liquidity programs.  The FOMC asked for lots of information, and now youre going to be sorry.",
    "We could just acquire Fannie and Freddie directly.",
    "Speaking of facility usage",
    "The next item on the agenda is billed as a discussion of the balance sheet and lending program issues.  What Id like to do, with your indulgence, is to start off by posting you on a number of developments that pertain to these programs, and then make some comments on some policy issues, and then we can have an open discussion.  I just want to remind everyone, of course, that we have two full go-rounds subsequent to this discussion, so lets make this part of it more informal, and then everyone will have an opportunity, of course, in the go-rounds to give their views if they havent had a chance in the discussion. Let me begin with some postings.  First, a relatively minor point.  Its time to announce the amounts and schedules for the term auction facility for the second quarter.  Unless there are \n   objections, I propose to follow the recommendation of the staff and approve $150 billion per auction in April. That would be the same as weve had for some time now. The second thing I wanted to talk about is the accord discussions with the Treasury, which I have mentioned a few times.  I think that we are getting somewhat close to a possible agreement, and I want to update you on where thats going, and its going to be relevant to some of the other points I want to make.  The subject of the accord will be a potential conflict between the Feds role as a monetary authority and as a financial stability authority, the point being:  How do we define the role of the Fed in such a way as to minimize the conflicts between those two functions?  Currently what we have in mind is a short document that would havebesides an introduction stating the motivationfour key general points. The first point would be a positive statement of the need for TreasuryFederal Reserve co-equal cooperation during this financial crisis, so that is a positive good and something that we want to continue to do. The second point is that, although the Fed may provide liquidity in its role of pursuing financial stability, the Fed must be insulated from credit risk and must not undertake credit allocation, which the accord will state are within the province of the fiscal authorities.  What is meant by credit allocationand this relates to some of the discussion about the TALFis that, to the extent that the Federal Reserve gets involved in credit markets, we should try to do so in a broad way that addresses the macroeconomic situation as opposed to picking winners and losers within small categories of credit. The third of the four principles is the need to protect the Feds monetary stability function from the financial stability function, if you will.  In particular, the Fed and the Treasury have agreed on the need for sterilization tools that will allow the Fed to prevent any increases in its \n   balance sheet from affecting its ability to conduct normal monetary policy.  As Brian already said, we have developed legislative language, and I have promises from the Administration of the highest level of effort to go to the Congress immediatelytodayto try to get reactions, try to get some approval of either Fed bills or the SFP program, and that would be attached to legislation that is currently being contemplated.  Ill say more about that.  As Brian mentioned, I think we would prefer Fed bills, but we are putting both out there. The other thing that we are prepared to do, if we get resistance, and which I think a few people around the table might prefer, is to put a sunset on Fed bills or on this provision, so that its only for the current situation. The fourth element of the accord would be an agreement between us on the need for a comprehensive resolution regime for systemically critical nonbank financial institutions, which we do not have, and which I have called for and others have called fora way to wind down nonbanks in a safe and orderly way. In particular, we would want to say that a key element of any such regime would be a careful definition of what role would be expected of the central bank. We might have a rolewe might have a liquidity provision role, we might have other roles, depending on what the Congress wants to dobut it should be carefully defined.  As part of this, sort of aspirationally, the Treasury at this pointand well just have to see how the negotiation comes outwill state its intention that when it is able to do so it will remove from our balance sheet the Maiden Lanes and the other residuals from our various rescue operations. So I believe that these are the main elements that we need.  From my perspective, it preserves our ability to do what were doing now, which is to continue to support credit market functioning and to address the macroeconomic situation, even though the interest rate is at the zero bound. I realize it doesnt go as far as some perhaps might like, but I do think that it will be \n  an important step, a historic step, towards defining an appropriate line between our various functions. It should be clear that a principal reason that the Treasury is being so cooperative is that they would like us to support them in their bank rescue program.  So what Id like to do now is tell you where that is and whats going on there, and talk to you about what the Feds role, if any, would be in that. And I should say that we have not approved anything.  But they are looking for some kind of answer from us very quickly, and, therefore, this would be an opportunity for people to make comments. The original bank proposal of the Treasury had five elements, of which four have now been laid out to the public: the supervisory assessment, with the stress scenario; the equity instrumentthe mandatory convertible preferredthat would be given to banks that need it; the TALFthe joint TALFwhich, of course, is already, as of this week, in operation; and the foreclosure mitigation plan.  The last element, which has not yet been described and that we want to get to, is a publicprivate partnership for dealing with what they now call legacy assets.  I guess its like legacy systemsand the word legacy used to be a good word.",
    "I have to say that I agree with the objective.  I supported the original TARP motivation, and a big part of that was to remove opaque and damaged assets from bank balance sheets.  I believe that is part of any successful bank cleanup program, because it will allow banks to attract private capital and give them balance sheet space to go back to normal lending.  So I do think thats an important element of the plan. Currently, this fifth element has, in turn, three parts.  This is very complicatedsorry.  The first part, which has nothing to do with the Fed, is an FDIC facility.  The purpose of the FDIC facility would be to take damaged portfolios directly off of the balance sheets of banks; \n   this would happen after the conclusion of our supervisory assessment, during the six-month period in which banks are supposed to be raising capital or otherwise taking action to stabilize themselves.  A bank would offer an asset pool, and a third-party valuation agent would estimate an expected price on the pool. Then, the supervisor and the bank would discuss implications for pro forma valuations and the stability of the bankcapital needs, and the like.  So there would be some preliminary discussion about whether or not the bank should actually engage in making this offer. If the bank decides to offer the asset pool, then the FDIC would dispose of it in the same way that it currently disposes of assets of failing banks:  It would have an auction, and the price that the bank receives for the pool would be determined by the winning bidder.  This is going to be highly leveraged, which is the reason that they hope to attract bidders who will pay more than fire-sale prices.  The leverage will come in two forms.  One is that there will be an 80/20 partnership between the U.S. government and the private participant, with 80 percent of the capital from the government.  And then, there is leverage provided by the FDIC, which is supported by FDIC guarantees, to attract funding.  An example of the leverage is that given a $19.5 billion portfolio, a private investor could have a 20 percent interest in it for $557 million obviously, this is a very highly leveraged position.  Why would banks want to do this?  Its not clear that they will, but there are some possible reasons. One is that we are looking in our supervisory assessment at embedded losses that go beyond one year, beyond the provisions.  So banks may make the determination that its in their interest to sell some portfolios, even if theyre in the accrual book.  Second is the proposition that, by selling off assets, a bank can make itself attractive to private equity and thereby, perhaps, avoid a capital injection from the U.S. government.  So thats the motivation.  Of course, typically, the sale of assets, if theyre marked down, would create a bigger capital \n  hole than initially, and so the U.S. government will have to stand ready to provide enough capital in case the private sector is not forthcoming. Thats the FDIC part of the plan.  It covers only portfolios sold directly by banks and possibly bank holding companies. The FDIC is not willing, or says it doesnt have the authority, to deal with assets that are not taken directly from banks.  The other two parts of the plan involve creating facilities to buy various classes of troubled or legacy assets, essentially from anybody in the market.  And the question is: How would they work? So thats where the Fed would be involved under the Treasurys proposal. Before I talk about them, let me just say one word about process.  The Fed has been a full participant in all of these discussions.  Weve done the lions share of the work on a number of these issues. And we have, in general, tried to resist the Treasurys strong demand for precipitant action, and tried to slow them down, and tried to make sure that we get this right, if at all possible. Weve also been very careful throughout this process in trying to ensure necessary protections for the Fedthats what the accord is about.  Another example is that we essentially vetoed a ring-fencing proposal, because we didnt like the way the Fed was involved in those types of operations. I should also say that I did have the opportunity to meet with the President on these issues; of course, we talked about a wide variety of things, but we spent about 20 minutes talking about the Feds role and our concerns and our issues, and he was very receptive.  In particular, he promised his full support for sterilization tools.  And Ill mention parenthetically that I have talked to him about inflation targets as well, and he said, That sounds really good.  Im sure his advisers will get to him before long",
    "Well, were one step ahead of the 1951 accord, which wasnt even written down.",
    "Im looking for a concrete example.  Id be more than happy to try to accommodate this kind of language if we can figure out how to do it.  Brian is already worried about missing dinner, Im sure.",
    "Well, Im certainly glad we avoided a go-round.",
    "This also relies on people being able to do geometric calculations.",
    "Well, well worry about SFP when we get it.",
    "Thank you. We can add to the statement, Wait until next year.",
    "Your drawl will be reflected in the transcript.",
    "Any questions? Okay.  I have the rare advantage of having had overnight to work out my summary of the discussion so it may be somewhat more coherent than usual.  Let me start with that.  The intermeeting period saw some tentative evidence of \nstabilization of real activity, or at least a slower decline relative to the earlier sharp contraction.  Indicators of possible stabilization appeared in data on consumption, housing, durable goods, regional manufacturing reports, and other areas.  Surveys and some anecdotal reports suggested a slightly greater confidence on the part of households and businesses.  Financial markets also generally improved.  Inventory decumulation has been brisk, suggesting possible increases in production in the medium term.  However, labor markets remained weak and global economic and financial conditions, adverse. Overall, participants were very cautious about taking too much signal from the incoming data, noting its tentative nature, particularly the improvement in the financial markets.  False dawns have occurred in previous recessions. To the extent that participants saw an upturn materializing, most thought that it would be relatively anemic because of factors such as financial headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging; the need for economic restructuring; slow global economic growth that may be lagging the U.S. cycle; and the high vulnerability of the fragile economy and financial system to shocks.  Further policy support, both in the United \n States and abroad, would be constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates and by the already high level of fiscal borrowing. Consumer spending shows some signs of bottoming out.  Fiscal stimulus will support consumer income going forward, and the rising stock market and possibly slower declines in house prices imply that wealth is no longer dropping so sharply.  There are at best, however, only the slightest indications of improvement in labor markets.  Unemployment claims and job losses remain high; firms are undertaking permanent reductions in labor force; and involuntary part-time work is unusually elevated.  Housing activity is giving some indications of stabilizing at a very low level, with affordability and buyer traffic up and inventories down.  However, prices \nare likely to continue to fall, in part because of the additions to supply from high rates of foreclosure. Production and investment remain weak, although firms attitudes are not quite as negative as they recently were.  Drilling and mining have been affected by commodity prices.  Export demand remains depressed.  Industrial production has continued to fall both here and abroad, and growth rates in both advanced and emerging-market economies have fallen significantly. China is somewhat stronger than other Asian countries, but perhaps not as strong as its official statistics imply; and like many other countries, it remains dependent on export demand.  Europe faces slow growth and potentially serious banking problems, including \nexposures to Eastern Europe. Financial market conditions generally had a better tone.  Stock prices rose, money markets exhibited better liquidity and lower spreads, corporate issuance of bonds and convertible securities is healthy, volatility is down, and other indicators of market functioning have improved.  Better financial conditions have helped confidence, even as indications of economic \n improvement have reduced risk aversion in markets.  However, financial markets had shown signs of improvement on several previous occasions before worsening again.  Moreover, although banks generally reported good earnings in the first quarter and their share prices rose, confidence in banksas shown in CDS spreads, for exampleremains tenuous.  A number of people observed that the disclosure of the capital assessment results on Monday will be a stress test in itself for the banks and the markets.  Credit continues to contract because of declining credit quality and loan demand, capital constraints on banks that dont want to base increased lending on government capital, and the unavailability of financing through securitization markets.  Lack of financing for commercial real estate remains a particularly serious issue.   Most see inflation as remaining low for the foreseeable future.  Slack looks to be high and increasing, as reflected in high unemployment and low capacity utilization.  Wages are growing more slowly.  With the slight improvement in the outlook and the incoming inflation data not particularly low, deflation risks have moderated but remain a worry for some participants. On the other hand, some expressed concerns about upside inflation risks, reflecting the possibility that the output gap is being overestimated and that forward-looking expectations may react to factors such as the Feds rapid balance sheet expansion and its purchases of \nTreasury securities. Effective exit strategies from Fed policies and good communication are necessary to maintain confidence that price stability will be achieved. So that is my overview.  Any comments or questions?  If not, let me make just a few comments, as usual. I am after Governor Tarullo, and so it is even more difficult for me than for him to come up with something new.  On the proverbial green shoots,",
    "Okay. Lets go back to our regularly scheduled program.",
    "Thank you. All right.  Well, I again have benefited from a good discussion. I think the policy discussionsdont take this the wrong wayare getting \nbetter.",
    "All right.  So let me ask all participants, all 1 people, for a yes or noor feel free not to vote.",
    "We dont want that.",
    "Any grammarians with concerns? You know, this is actually kind of fun here.",
    "Dont get them started.",
    "It did sop up the excess reserves, though.",
    "If we got rid of it, it would be a relief for Bill Nelson, Im sure.",
    "I thank you. Just very quickly, let me summarize a few things. I think there was a lot of support for Brians recommendations.  The only issue I heard was some discussion about raising the bid rate on the TAF.  You can raise the rate by cutting the quantity or by raising the rate. I think the optics are a little bit risky to be raising the rate.  I would be inclined to go with the recommendation that the staff has put forward. On the exit strategy, I guess I disagree with President Lacker.  I think its important for us to have these other tools to diversify our ability to sterilize reserves.  A number of things are very interestingreverse repos, collateralized lending, term deposits.  And we didnt talk about redemptions, but redemptions actually are part of this, too.  Thats going to be significant over the next couple of years. I think most people agree that it would be very valuable to have as \n    detailed as possible a discussion of the exit strategy in the Monetary Policy Report.  And I think there was good support for that, and we should proceed with that. Finally, on the Desk and flexibility, there didnt seem to be much interest in giving you a great deal of flexibility.",
    "FOMC are not sheep.",
    "Is this the Warren Beatty who starred in Reds?",
    "President Bullard, we already moved it from the top of the statement all the way down to paragraph 3.",
    "Thank you, everybody. I think that most of us are agreed that, given the improvement in the economy, theres not much need to change our policy stance today, so we should keep our programs in place on the schedule that we have already announced. That would bring us to alternative B, which I think is the right choice.  Most of you were in favor of striking the last sentence. I think thats the right decision.  Im reminded of an experience I had when I first took this job, when we were still raising interest rates.  Remember that?  I told a congressional committee that the time would come, eventually, when we would have to stop raising interest rates.  Of course, the expectation of an immediate rate change went right through the market, and I was completely flabbergasted by the inability of the markets to understand plain English.",
    "Good afternoon, everybody.  Today is the last meeting for our colleague Gary Stern. Gary first attended the FOMC meeting as a staffer in 1982 and then was appointed President in March 1985. To provide some cultural context, in 1982 the top grossing movie was An Officer and a Gentleman, followed closely by Tootsie.",
    "The leading hit song was Physical by Olivia Newton-John.",
    "Okay. We are in the Q&A session for Brian.",
    "Let the record show that President Lackers reference to ARMs dealers had to do with mortgages and not with other things.",
    "No, no, no, no.",
    "Buying and selling we know how to do.",
    "Thank you. Is the coffee ready, do you think?",
    "Other questions?  Let me just recognize you, President Bullard. But lets not get completely into the debate at this point.",
    "One-hander, okay.",
    "I think I detected a little appetite for coffee around the table.",
    "Why dont we recommence?  Weve had a number of issues raised by the presentations. First, there were some recommendations from the Desk on large-scale asset purchases, including possible tapering strategies.  Second, we had some discussion of reserve management tools and the progress there.  Third, there was a proposal essentially on the TAF and the TSLF. Let me just mention parenthetically that, as I understand it from talking to Scott, no votes are needed to implement those proposals, because the TSLF directive in particular told the Desk to wind down the options as conditions permit.  Id be happy to hear comments.  But if people would like to disagree with the press release or the plan, please say so. If we get more or less consensus around the table, we wont have to take a formal action on that, I think. So those are three topics that we can talk about. This part of the meeting is billed on the agenda as an opportunity for informal, unstructured interaction",
    ", which I am going to duck, I think, in a minute.  I hope this is a chance for us just to have some interchange.  Let me just be very clear that we will not be making any decisions in this part of the meeting; the decisions on large-scale asset purchases, \nand so on, will be taken tomorrow in the policy round.  So please dont feel that you are \ncompelled to speak in order to get your voice heardyou will be heard.  But it would be useful, I think, to have some additional discussion. Before we get into that, I just wanted to say a word or two about the quantitative easing mechanism, because I feel as if theres a certain amount of confusion going on.  So let me just say three straightforward things. The first point, and I think we all agree on this, is that any action we takethrough purchases or auctions or whateverto put reserves into the banking system, on net, will be expansionary, because whatever the banks do along the lines of what they told Bill English and \n   his colleagueswhether its buying other assets, or lending, or whatever action they takewill tend to be expansionary.  Of course, in equilibrium this will be reflected in lower short-term interest rates across a range of potential assets.  And thats essentially how quantitative easing works. Its meant to be expansionary, and I think it would be in the context that were using it here. President Yellen made a good point during the break, which was that quantitative easing should be expansionary even if the leverage ratio were binding.  The reason is that, in order to avoid the leverage ratio, firms would either have to get rid of managed liabilities or lower deposit rates and otherwise prevent the inflow of cash into their institution.  If depositors are not incentivized to put money into banks, they will go to money market mutual funds or to other types of short-term credit markets, and that, again, will have the effect of lowering short-term \ninterest rates, and, therefore, be expansionary.  So I dont think that there really is any barrier to quantitative easing being effective in our current institutional environment.   The second observation I would make is based on Bills simulations; based on what we know, we think the quantitative easing effects are probably pretty small.  Short-term interest rates are already low. They might be made a little bit lower by quantitative easing, but I dont \nsee much chance of a huge overshoot in a short period of time.  I think thats not what the evidence suggests. Its not what the Japanese experience suggests.  So quantitative easing should be expansionary, but I dont see it as being a major part of our overall monetary policy stance. And then, the third thing Id like to say is that we can exit from the high level of reserves.  We have, in fact, three methods to do thatwe have two belts as well as a pair of suspenders.  First of all, we have the interest on reserves, which may be leaky, but certainly if its raised high enough it will tighten policythere seems to be little doubt about that.  Second, we have the various ways of sterilizing reserves through reverse repos or time deposits.  I wasnt quite clear \n about the timing, but my sense is that these things will be coming online by early next year.  So over the time frame in which we would have to do a significant amount of tightening, we should have the tools in place to do that.  Then, of course, the third method we know we can do is sell assets. I think that that would not only have effects via the reversal of quantitative easing, but it also would have very powerful signaling and market effects.   These are very important issues for us to understand.  But I felt there was an impression somehow that we were not in control of the situation.  I dont think thats true.  Obviously, its a difficult and novel situation, but I do think that the staff and all of us working together have a pretty good understanding of how to manage this and how this relates to standard monetary policy. So thats my little homily.  Let me now open up the floor for any comments on asset purchases, reserve management, TAF, TSLF, any of those things that anyone would like to bring up, and I would invite interaction.  Would anyone like to raise any points?  Ah, President Lacker, I knew I could count on you.",
    "Well, this may be it.",
    "You dont go with a square root sign, though.",
    "We all have to make sacrifices.",
    "Thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for useful discussion. Im going to attempt here to summarize what Ive heard and then make a few additional comments. In summary, the outlook improved during the intervening period, particularly with respect to economic growth over the remainder of the year, and most participants believe that recovery had begun. Although anecdotal information suggests that businesses and households remain quite cautious, a number of factors should support growth over the next few quarters, including reduced inventory accumulation, higher auto sales and production, modest increases in \n housing activity and prices, some stabilization in household spending, better financial conditions, and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. The outlook for the medium term also seems better than at the last meeting, but there remains considerable uncertainty about whether final demand growth will be sustained once government policy supports, including special measures such as cash-for-clunkers and the first-time homebuyers credit, begin to wane.  The modal view was that the recovery in 2010 could be relatively slowmaybe a checkmark",
    "perhaps around the long-run potential growth rate, a rate that would be too slow to reduce the unemployment rate significantly next year. Some suggested that downside risks to growth remained as well.  Inflation remains relatively low, but there was some disagreement about the factors that most influence inflation in the medium term and about the risks associated with our current mix of policies. Retail sales and consumer spending have picked up a bit, in part reflecting special factors, such as the cash-for-clunkers program.  Some consumer fundamentals are improved.  Notably, household wealth is rising again, and labor income may be stabilizing.  Sentiment, though still low, has improved, and there is possibly some pent-up demand.  However, especially weak labor markets, tight credit, and the slowing of the benefits of the stimulus package seem likely to restrain consumption growth.  Saving rates have been relatively stable, but the evolution of the saving rate remains an important uncertainty in the near term. In the housing sector, sales and starts have looked somewhat better, and house prices have actually risen a bit. Higher house prices not only increase household wealth, but they also improve the quality of mortgage-related assets and, by reducing the effective cost of capital, encourage home purchase.  However, foreclosures are likely to continue to put pressure on prices \n    by raising supply. Other risks to housing are the ending of the temporary tax credit for first-time homebuyers and the end of the Feds MBS purchase program. Activity in the nonresidential sector continues to decline sharply in most Districts, reflecting both worsening fundamentals and severe credit constraints.  In the business sector, managers are relieved that the worst scenarios have not come to pass, but, as already noted, many remain wary and uncertain about the recovery, and there is some disconnect between their perceptions and the relative strengths seen in the aggregate data. Business caution, together with low utilization rates and substantial excess capacity, suggest that many firms may be slow to add workers and make new capital investments.  Cost-cutting has contributed to productivity gains.  The sustainability of those gains is unclear but is potentially an important issue, for example, in determining whether the recovery will be jobless and how slack will evolve. Manufacturing surveys show some improvement, probably reflecting in part rising volumes of global trade and activity.  Indexes show a moderate increase in manufacturers expectations of prices paid and received.  Reports on retailing and services remain somewhat mixed.  Health care has done well, transportation less so.  Agriculture and natural gas production have been affected by lower prices. The labor market remains very weak, but may be close to the bottom.  Layoffs have slowed somewhat. Theyre still high, and UI claims are falling only gradually.  Gross hiring is weak. Wage growth is moderate, presumably reflecting the weakness of the market.  Unemployment is expected to decline only slowly, given the expectation that economic growth will not be significantly above potential next year, and given the recent experience of jobless \nrecoveries. \n   Improvements in financial markets over the intermeeting period were not dramatic, but the substantial gains in the past six months were largely sustained.  Risk-taking and momentum have returned to the markets.  The decline in longer-term Treasury yields is somewhat puzzling, but at least for now it is supportive of recovery.  However, credit risks in the banking system remain substantial, particularly in residential and commercial mortgages.  Bank credit remains tight. Bank loans to smaller businesses, households, and commercial real estate, in particular, have fallen dramatically.  Securitization markets still are limited in their activity.  Banks terms continue to tighten, perhaps in part due to regulatory pressures. Inflation has been relatively stable, with a modest downward trend in the core, and the risks around inflation seem more balanced.  Wages and unit labor costs are decelerating, but, on the other hand, the dollar is weakening and commodity prices are up.  Participants differed on the fundamental determinants of inflation and consequently on their forecasts, and emphasis on inflation expectations as a driver of inflation, together with the Greenbook assumption that policy will stay easy much longer than markets expect, led some to worry about higher inflation in the medium term.  Alternatively, even if slack is an unreliable determinant of inflation in normal times, the very high level of slack that probably exists today could create disinflationary pressures. Very possibly, the stability of inflation expectations as measured in financial markets or in surveys may be disguising a great deal of uncertainty about how policy and inflation will ultimately evolve. Given the long lags of policy and uncertainties about the effects of unconventional policies, continued clarity about and attention to the Feds policies and exit strategy are important for retaining confidence. \n Any comments? (No response.) Okay. With that let me just add a few thoughts.  I come after Governor Tarullo, so its even more difficult for me. I think were all glad that the general view seems to be that the near-term outlook will be better; the data since the last meeting support that view.  Of course, the question that everyone has alluded to is whether this near-term pickup will be sustainable going into 2010.  I think that this is actually a very complicated question, and there are good arguments on both sides.  So at \nthe risk of being a little bit pedantic, Im going to do point and counterpoint and talk a bit about some of what I see as the main forces on the two sides. If you look at the case for sustainability, there are a lot of factors which suggest that final demand will be sustained next year.  I think the housing market developments are particularly important in this regard, and the staff has noted the improvements in house-price outlooks.  As President Yellen noted, this is not just a matter of wealthit potentially affects asset quality.  In addition, because expected price changes are part of the cost of capitalor, put another way, people dont want to buy houses when the prices are fallingsome sense that prices are stabilizing may be very helpful in terms of residential construction.  I think it is literally the case that since Ive been Chairman, there has not been a single quarter in which residential construction has added to the GDP.",
    "I wont go down as the housing Chairman, but the third quarter, apparently, may be different. The labor market is very weak, but overall, as job losses have moderated and as hours have improved slightly and wages have improved slightly, labor income is beginning to stabilize, which is an important precondition for multiplieraccelerator developments next year. Financial markets are, of course, very positive, and I would note that not only are they a cause of improved conditions in terms of credit availability and in terms of the positive financial \n feedback loop, but they are also reflective of expectations.  In particular, developments in the stock market and the shape of the yield curve are suggestive that confidence about recovery is returning. On the consumer side, I mentioned last time that I felt comfortable with the Greenbooks assumption that saving rates will be stable going forward, in which case we should begin to see growth in consumption that will support a more sustained recovery.  And supporting that is the fact that wealth is beginning to turn around and that the drag from the losses of wealth over the last couple of years will begin to fade over time. The global recovery is another positive, although the effects are different and work through different channels. But, certainly, I think one of the reasons that manufacturing looks to be leading this recovery must be at least in part because of the exposure of manufacturing to trade. Finally, on the sustainability side, as Ted Truman and others have been reminding us, the norm for a deep recession is a fairly strong recovery, and there certainly are factors like pent-up demand and inventory adjustments that tend to bring economies back faster than sometimes is anticipated. On the other hand",
    ", there are some things that go against some of these basically optimistic forces.  A number of people have talked about the temporary nature of many of the government programs that are supporting economic growth nowthe housing market is a clear case of that.  People have mentioned the first-time homebuyers tax credit, which is now expiring. Presumably the Fed at some point will not be able to maintain the downward pressure on mortgage rates.  And there are other things going on as well, including developments in the GSEs, losses at the FHA that may force them to tighten their terms, and probably an increased \npace of foreclosures as some of the moratoria and other delays end.  So the housing market is not out of the woods by any means, and the Greenbook does take into account a possible relapse in house prices. The labor market recovery looks much more like a jobless or very slow recovery than the alternative. For example, the UI claims, although falling, are doing so quite slowly, and we are all aware of the fact that the duration of unemployment is quite high, which is going to affect labor force attachment and skills and so on. The productivity issue really cuts both ways, as we discussed yesterday.  At least in the 2001 recovery, there was a close relationship between productivity at the micro level and phenomena associated with a jobless recovery.  I would point out that the Greenbook is not really forecasting a jobless recovery.  They anticipate, as I count here, 2.2 million payroll jobs in 2010 and 3.8 million in 2011 being added, which of course is possible, but it could be weaker than that if productivity and other forces are drags. The improvements in financial markets are very encouraging, but the banking system, I think, remains the most important exception, with credit being quite tight and potential losses being very, very important in that sector.  I was interested to hear Governor Dukes comments about the banks views vis--vis my own views.  In general they are being very, very cautious, in any case, about lending. Consumer spending has not yet demonstrated that it will be sustainable.  Cash-foclunkers and other measures, like the tax credits and transfers of the fiscal program, are, of course, temporary, and more broadly, the fiscal stimulus will begin to decline next year, as will the inventory correction. \n And finally, although there is a presumption that a deep recession will be followed by a strong recovery, we have talked in this forum for a number of months about the many headwinds that we face, including leverage issues, credit issues, and various imbalances, for example, fiscal and trade imbalances, that need to be corrected. So Ive gone through all of these things not only to show you what an open-minded person I am",
    "Okay. The last two minutes will be struck.",
    "All right.",
    "The first item on our agenda is financial developments, open market operations, and",
    "Let the record show that President Plosser is wearing a Phillies hat.",
    "Okay. The next item on the agenda is billed as an opportunity for interaction",

    "Hit to the right side.",
    "Thank you very much, and thanks to everybody for their valuable input.  Let me make an effort to summarize the discussions I heard at least, and then Ill make a few additional comments. Participants noted the recent, more-positive economic data.  After four quarters of decline, we have seen positive economic growth again, as had been anticipated, and moderate GDP growth should continue in the fourth quarter.  Factors contributing to growth in the near term include the ongoing slowdown in the pace of inventory decumulation, fiscal actions to support autos and housing, and some signs of life in consumer spending. However, as many one-off factors affected final demand in the third quarter, it is difficult to separate the signal from the noise, leaving considerable uncertainty about the strength of the recovery going forward.  Most participants see the economy growing at a moderate pace in 2010, a pace that would imply a very slow decline in unemployment.  Risks to the economic growth outlook are roughly balanced, with conditions in financial and labor markets posing threats to growth but the possibility of a stronger consumer and strong productivity growth creating upside risks.  Concerns remain about the dependence of the economy on government support and the ability of the economy to deliver a self-sustaining recovery without that support.  One participant characterized the likely recovery as a long slog, and one thought of it as a checkmark, which we will continue to evaluate.  The emerging global recovery, especially in emerging markets, is supportive of economic growth here. With respect to inflation, the risks seem roughly balanced as well, with some arguing that slack will lead to declining core inflation and others noting that rising energy prices, policy expectations, and inflation expectations that may not be as anchored as we would like are upside risks. Some saw slower inflation in the near term but upside risks further out.  Consumer spending \n      is modestly stronger, even outside autos.  However, weak labor markets, the poor condition of household balance sheets, declines in net worth, and tight credit are drags on sentiment and the ability to spend. Labor income is flat as hours decline and wage growth slows.  How the saving rate will evolve is difficult to anticipate, but further declines in the saving rate from here do seem unlikely. Housing activity has improved, and house prices have risen modestly in some areas.  Inventories of housing are down, and we may have seen a bottom.  However, factors such as the first-time homebuyer tax credit and Fed MBS purchases may be driving that trend to some extent.  Builders, especially smaller builders, remain pessimistic. Business owners generally remain quite cautious and continue to focus on cost savings in the absence of significant top-line revenue growth.  The resulting productivity gains have been impressive.  However, there is substantial reluctance to hire or invest, except possibly abroad, due to uncertainty about prospective demand and about Washingtons grape-shot approach to policy.  Continued strengths in parts of the global economy, notably Asia, have helped to increase exports supporting manufacturing, though net exports are not likely to be a large net contributor to GDP growth overall. The labor market remains very weak.  As noted, firms continue to look aggressively for cost savings and see little need to hire even if demand expands.  Small businesses, which are normally a source of employment growth in recoveries, have been hit especially hard by the credit crunch and weak demand. UI claims are falling, and job cuts are moderating, but both are still high.  The employment-to-population ratio is at a long-term low.  Firms will be able to increase hours to meet increases in demand, delaying the need to add to payrolls.  We must take account of the possibility of a jobless recovery. \n       Financial markets have shown signs of healing, with asset prices much higher than earlier this year and credit spreads much narrower.  More recently, though, the markets have moved sideways reflecting uncertainty about recovery, and continued improvement is not guaranteed.  Large firms with access to public markets are having little difficulty obtaining credit.  They also hold plenty of cash.  Smaller, bank-dependent firms are having a more difficult time, however.  The situation for banks is mixed.  Rising nonperforming loans will be a continuing source of stress, but there is some optimism about future credit losses, and profits and liquidity are both improved.  Poorly rated banks, in particular, are not lending but are trying to improve their capital ratios by shedding assets, and many participants cited commercial real estate as a major concern both for the banking system and for the broader economy.  Banks are also affected by policy uncertainty both here and abroad. Finally, on inflation, core inflation and median inflation are slowing, but headline inflation will be increased somewhat by price increases in energy, commodities, and imports.  Wages and unit labor costs have slowed, the latter reflecting sharp gains in productivity.  Firms report that they have no pricing power.  Participants continue to disagree on the appropriate weights to place on resource slack, inflation expectations, and other factors in forecasting inflation.  Substantial resource slack and slow wage growth may tend to push inflation down; on the other hand, inflation expectations may be less anchored and more disperse than they appear and could be vulnerable to the publics concerns about the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions that have been taken or to disorderly declines in the dollar. Participants discussed the measurement of market expectations of monetary policy; the need to communicate exit plans and to exit at the appropriate time; the need to allow asset purchases and other aspects of policy to respond on the margin to changes in economic outlook; and the \n          determinants of inflation expectations and potential output.  Thats my summary.  Comments, reactions? All right. Let me make just a few additional comments here.  As everyone has noted, the intermeeting data were modestly encouraging.  We saw third-quarter economic growth, and we expect the fourth quarter to be positive as well.  Markets have become somewhat more uncertain, though, about the durability of the recovery and also perhaps about how this Committee will proceed. The issue remains for everyone, I think, what will happen after the end of this yearhow the recovery will look in 2010.  At the last meeting I described my outlook as muddled, and I remain firmly in that position.",
    "If pressed, however, I would acknowledge that I feel somewhat more concerned about 2010, although I did make my balance of risks balanced.  As many of you have noted, the behavior of the consumer is very important, and I guess the good news, at least from a cyclical point of view, is that the Greenbook seems right so far that were not seeing a major increase in the household saving rate that would be, at least in the short term, a problem for the recovery. However, I do think there are some significant downside risks to that scenario, particularly in the labor market and the banking sector, and let me just talk about those a bit.  As Governor Kohn mentioned, the saving rate actually is quite low, given many of the fundamentals, and it seems very possible that it may rise if the labor market remains as weak as it appears.  I would like to discuss the labor market briefly because I think we really need to focus on the labor market as one of the key elements of the recovery. My sense is that, even given the bad headline numbers in terms of unemployment and payrolls, the labor market may be even weaker than it looks.  For example, insured unemployment \n        on regular state programs, the UI claims we check every Thursday morning, have peaked and come down significantly, and the outstanding stock of people on unemployment insurance is down to about six million.  But when you look at UI claims plus regular UI plus extended and emergency benefits, the number is ten million and has not peaked.  It is still very, very high.  Recently the BLS announced benchmark revisions that will lower the level of employment by another 850,000 jobs.  So joblessness, employment-to-population ratios, and so on are extraordinarily high.  Moreover, that joblessness has a very large component of permanent separations and long-term unemployment.  As weve seen in the last two recessionslooking at JOLTS data, for examplehiring rates are particularly weak, particularly contributing to the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment, which is not encouraging as we look forward to the possibility of a jobless recovery. Just note that different demographic groups are reacting differently to the very poor state of the labor market.  Prime age males who have high attachment to the labor force have not dropped out of the labor force, but their unemployment rate has jumped much more significantly than that for the labor force as a whole.  On the other hand, younger workers under age 24 have been dropping out of the labor force, and participation rates there are considerably down.  So my first general point is just that the weakness is perhaps even worse and more pervasive than the unemployment rate may suggest. Second, looking forward, theres not much indication of increased hiring, at least in the medium term.  You can see that in anecdotes we heard today.  You can see that in surveys, and I think there is the point that others have made, but is worth mentioning again, that, despite all the cuts, despite the cost savings, firms have quite a bit of capacity to increase labor input without adding full-time workers, including calling back workers on furlough, adding hours to part-time \n     workers, increasing work weeks and adding overtime, and adding temporary workers, which adds to the number of people employed but not obviously to longer-term employment. A third point is that jobless recoveries almost by definition involve high productivity growth rates, and all of the indications so far suggest that, in fact, employers are finding those cost savings, which of course is good for the long term but again is a negative for future employment. Then the fourth and final point I want to make about the labor market is that we need to think about the interaction between the labor market and the credit markets.  There is a tremendous contraction going on in bank lending.  Nominal C&I bank loans outstanding are down about 12 percent, or $200 billion, over the past three quarters, and although we have seen some improvement in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, we still have net tightening in that area.  As people have noted, for large firms the bank lending contraction may not be such a big problem.  They have access to the public markets, and they have lots of cash.  But for small firms, I think it is a serious problem, as many of you have heard from your constituents.  Not only are bank lending and bank credit lines for small firms highly restricted, but in addition, you have the greatly reduced availability of home equity lines and credit card lines, which are important for very small businesses as a source of credit.  As a result of this, the small business hiring plans as reported by the NFIB are sharply below the troughs of 1990 and 2001 and have not improved at all from the worst levels of earlier this year. Now, there is an ongoing debate on the importance of small business in job creation.  There are some exaggerated numbers out there that are often used in political discourse.  The net creation of jobs by small businesses is much less than the gross creation because of the rapid turnover of small firms, but thats a steady-state observation.  In the growth phase of the business cycle, because small businesses are so cyclical, they actually contribute substantially, perhaps 40 percent or more, \n     to job additions during a recovery.  So the credit problems that they face could be an important problem directly affecting employment. Let me just say a couple of words about the credit crunch and banks.  I was encouraged to hear Governor Dukes views on banks.  There are some encouraging signs in terms of profitability, liquidity, and credit quality.  Nevertheless, as I mentioned before, the actual lending, the willingness to lend, and loans outstanding are quite constrained, and were seeing again very sharp declines in outstanding credit.  An interesting question is whether or not the declines in credit in the banking sector are the normal response to a deep recession or whether there is something additional going on. I may have remarked on this before, but to try to test that weve done vector auto regression analysis that includes bank credit, nominal GDP, and terms and conditions of lending, indicators from the SLOOS.  And what you find, interestingly, is that the decline in lending can be explained by the combination of slow growth and tighter conditions.  So in that respect it is normal, but the tightening of conditions itself is far greater than would be expected historically given the decline in the economy.  So what seems to be happening is that firms are making loans, but they are doing so under unusually tight terms and conditions, even conditional on the depth of the recession.  Now, there are two possible explanations for that.  One is that credit quality is worse than usual even given the state of the recession.  The other is that banks own problems, capital and so on, are restricting credit. In either case, that is concerning and suggests that the financial headwinds will be there as we go forward. Again, I do think that both the labor market and the credit markets are going to be very formidable issues going forward and make a moderate-to-slow recovery more likely than a rapid recovery. That being said, I just want to say for the record that there are some upside risks to \n          economic growth as well, and theyre a little harder to identify almost by necessity since one never knows where growth is going to come from, but these are important considerations. I want to talk once more, as I did last time, a bit about implications of low interest rates.  I think most would agree that there is a good policy case from the economys point of view for maintaining low rates. But I think we also would all agree that we need to continue to monitor any possible side effects from low rate policies that might be concerning.  One set of issues is speculative excesses, and I will say that we are trying here at the Boardand I hope you will at the Reserve Banks as wellto monitor even more closely than usual the state of asset prices as they evolve.  My sense isand Brian Sack talked about this yesterdaythat U.S. asset prices, so far at least, do not show any strong evidence of mispricing or asset bubbles.  In particularly, equity premiums are still above normal, so stock prices dont seem unusually high. Bond spreads seem reasonable given expected default rates in the state of the economy, and so on.  So in the United States so farthough as I say, we need to continue to monitor itI dont see that as being a near-term concern, although there is obviously a lot chatter about it, and that is one reason I think we need to be particularly attentive.   There is more concern about what is happening in Asia, where some markets seem to be overheated.  I just would make a point there, which is that the link between those asset prices in Asia and our monetary policy may be weaker than is sometimes believed.  There is a view espoused in some quarters that, because of the exchange rate management in Asia, Federal Reserve policies are essentially just imported into the Asian economies and, therefore, are a source of overheating in those economies.  A recent paper here at the Board by Erceg, Guerrieri, and Kamin looks at that from a number of different perspectives.  One of the interesting points that they make is that, if you look at the monetary policy indicatorsshort-term interest rates, for examplein Asian countries, \n           including China, and compare them with the U.S. federal funds rate, you see quite a bit of divergence because of capital controls and because of imperfect substitutability among assets.  Asia does seem to have some ability to conduct independent monetary policy. In that respect they obviously need to conduct policy thats appropriate for their region.  In addition, they have various kinds of quantitative controls on credit and on prices, and they also have fiscal policy.  So I think we need to pay attention to the Asian situation, but I would caution us not to overstate the responsibility of our policy for those excesses. A second area that we need to pay attention to in terms of the side effects from the low interest rates is the behavior of the dollar.  There were some anxious moments in the markets during the intermeeting period, but if you look at the pattern of the dollar over the last year or so, it seems to have been a fairly predictable and orderly evolution.  What we have seen, of course, is a rise in the dollar associated with safe haven demand and then an unwinding of that safe haven demand as the financial markets have improved.  Indeed, the current value of the dollar is about the same as it was before the crisis, the same as in June 2007, and nominal and real broad indexes are either equal to or higher than what they were in 1995.  So we see that there is not a really large secular movement in the dollar.  Moreover, a lower dollar may be necessarywe dont know for sureto address the current account situation.  The other relevant fact, I think, is that so far we dont see any evidence of a shift away from the dollar in reserve holdings.  But all that said, an orderly depreciation is orderly until its not orderly, and then at that point there may be a change, and we may be concerned.  I think an unstable dollar does have costs both for us and for the international monetary system, and obviously it also has implications for commodity prices, inflation expectations, and so on, which could force our hand or hamper our policy in ways that we would \n    otherwise not want to go.  So, again, I think that this is an area that we need to continue to pay attention to. Ive talked about inflation before.  Im not going to reiterate.  I think were all waiting for Jeff Fuhrer and the presentation in December to finally resolve all of the differences on the Committee about the dynamics of inflation.",
    "The counterargument is that we can only put this off.  All right, recognizing that there is some risk, we will have to see what happens. The last question I want to ask was raised by President Lacker first, and I think others, which is the phrase low rates of resource utilization.  Now, ironically, the reason that I was in favor of dropping very was in deference to President Lacker.",
    "Groundswell is supported.  All right. Well be democratic.  What is the view on very?  Who favors very? Anyone else? All right. So I think we have about as much of a consensus as we can get.  Well, having gone through this at some length, we have ended up with the status quo.",
    "This is great monetary economics.",
    "Coffee awaits.",
    "Thank you. I know youre all expecting a crisp, linear summary of the go-round, but I see that its past 5:30",
    "The power of the media.",
    "Thank you. Any questions for Bill? [No response.] Okay. I did have overnight to put together my pithy summary, so let me just try to summarize what I thought was a good discussion yesterday. Economic indicators since the last meeting were generally a bit more positive than expected. Participants cited the November labor report, retail sales, trade data, housing, and financial developments as positive.  Global economic growth is picking up, more so in emerging markets than in advanced economies, some of which remain weak.  However, although downside risks to growth may be a bit smaller, most participants were not ready to revise their expectations substantially for 2010 from previous projections of moderate growth and continued high unemployment.  Anecdotes repeatedly cited uncertainties on the part of business leaders about both near-term and medium-term prospects, reflecting questions about the economy itself and a range of government policies, including fiscal, climate, regulatory, and others.  These uncertainties, which are shared by the meeting participants, seem likely to retard new investment \nand hiring for some time.  Participants also debated whether private final demand will be \nsustained as government supports are withdrawn.  Housing provides an example.  Although there have been some significant improvements, these may not continue next year as the Fed stops buying MBS, the GSEs reduce their portfolios and tighten terms, the first-time homebuyer tax credit ends, and slow progress in mortgage modification fails to prevent another wave of foreclosures and distressed sales.  On the inflation front, price changes seem reasonably well \n  controlled, with some expecting further moderation, especially in core inflation, but others citing possible medium-term risks.   Looking at a bit more detail, recent data on consumer spending were encouraging, as noted. Income and saving this year were stronger than initially estimated.  Household wealth is increasing, and sentiment has recently improved some.  Evidence on Christmas buying is mixed.  Consumers appear to be aggressive in limiting ticket sizes and pursuing discounts.  Households \nwere likely encouraged by somewhat better news about the labor market, but high unemployment seems likely to cap growth in consumer confidence and spending. In the labor market, elements of good news besides reduced job loss included increased hours, reduced unemployment claims, and more temporary hires.  However, although job losses have moderated, firms remain quite reluctant to hire, and conditions overall remain very weak.  \nExtended high unemployment, which seems likely if growth is not much above trend, could leave lasting scars on the labor force. As also noted, CEOs remain cautious.  Large firms have good access to credit, but are holding lots of cash rather than hiring and investing.  Smaller bank-dependent firms find credit much more difficult to obtain, although there was some difference of view as to whether these constraints would prevent small firms from expanding when demand picks up.  Productivity gains have been significant, as firms have cut costs or looked to meet demand without adding workers. Certain segments are performing better, including some manufacturing businesses, high tech, and agriculture, and shippers have seen an uptick in their business. Financial markets continue to improve, although the risk of relapse cannot be ignored.  Some markets, such as securitization markets, are still not functioning well.  Generally, asset values do not seem out of line with fundamentals, although as investors have become less \n  cautious they may have also become less discriminating.  Market sentiment has been strong enough to overcome setbacks, like the Dubai episode, but this episode may be indicative of the vulnerability of sovereign credits.  Banks are raising capital and in some cases paying back the TARP. Bank credit, however, continues to contract, reflecting lack of demand, weak borrower quality, the risky macro environment, and bank concerns about their own capital positions.  Some banks complain about overzealous examiners.  Banks are looking for credit losses to top out in 2010, except in commercial real estate.  Large and small banks have different portfolio mixes, with small banks particularly vulnerable to the worsening CRE problem, and many are \nstill likely to fail.  Small banks are also more likely to be lenders to small businesses. Inflation seems reasonably controlled.  Core inflation seems to be moderating, though the underlying trend is not entirely clear, not only because of some energy pass-through but also some special factors, including an increase in the prices of nonmarket components.  The median CPI and trimmed mean PCE inflation are flat to down.  Anecdotes suggest that firms have limited ability to raise prices in most cases.  Compensation figures were revised up, but wage growth in general still appears quite moderate, and unit labor costs are further reduced by strong productivity; that is, in terms of the models, marginal costs do not seem to be rising quickly.  \nInflation expectations are broadly stable, though inflation risk premiums increase the difficulty of extracting these expectations from TIPS. As has been the case, views around the table differed on the size of the output gap and its relevance to inflation determination.  Energy price increases and declines in the dollar have recently reversed. Medium-term risks, other than the Feds balance sheet, include the U.S. fiscal situation and import costs.  We discussed the structure of the Feds policy regime, including exit-sequencing and the development and communication of a policy rule.  Thats my overview of \n what I heard. Obviously, theres diversity among the group.  Are there any comments or questions? [No response.] As always, its very difficult to add intelligent new and insightful ideas after all of you have already spoken, but let me just say a couple things.  First, like everybody else, I was heartened by the intermeeting data, and I think I may have taken just a bit more signal than some of you from it.  In particular, even though the overall economic growth in the second half was not much changed by the revised data, the contour was changed.  The third quarter was weaker, the fourth quarter looks to be relatively strong, perhaps 4 percent or more, and so there is a sense of somewhat more momentum going into 2010. At the same time, we saw developments, particularly in the consumer sector, which are a bit encouraging towards the view that, as inventory adjustments follow through and as other temporary factors weaken, final demand will be able to pick up and continue the moderate recovery that we anticipate in 2010. So, like most of you, I havent significantly revised my modal forecast, but I do have somewhat more confidence that the momentum will be sustained \ninto Looking specifically at the consumer, a number of things were encouraging.  I think the simple fact that there was more demand for housing and autos is actually encouraging, not just in terms of total spending dollars but also because the willingness of consumers to commit to longer-term durable goods is in itself an indication of greater confidence in their own income and the future of the economy.  And, more generally, we did see improved attitudes as measured, for example, with the Michigan survey.  Althoughlets be carefultheyre still very low in historical terms, and though the current conditions index improved considerably, the expected \nconditions measure didnt do very much.  So we are seeing some improvement there, but, again, we should be cautious. \n     On consumer fundamentals, we have seen the upgrade of income, which, as some have noted, helps explain how you can consume more and save more at the same time",
    "Thank you very much.  As usual, it was a very informative and diverse discussion. Lets talk a bit very broadly. Were going to come back in January and talk a lot about tactics. Let me just address for a moment this broad question:  Is policy too easy or too tight at this juncture?  You know, there is a fairly substantial view out therePaul Krugman and Joe Gagnon, for example, have expressed itthat by the Taylor Rule we are still several hundred basis points too tight, that we should, therefore, be doing a lot more asset purchases.  President Yellen, I think, was alluding to that.  So I think there is a respectable view which says that we should be looking to ease further rather than to be tightening.  The reason I personally, at least, am not convinced that thats the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we can take at this point and effective easing in the markets is not at all clear.  For example, on the one hand, mortgage rates are already extraordinarily lowits not clear that we can lower them \nmuch more.  And there are certainly risks associated with substantial further expansion of asset purchases, including destabilizing inflation expectations, causing commodity prices to rise, or causing the dollar to start to fall, all of which could lead to a reaction which would be actually a net negative. So while I see merit in the idea that we should, in some sense, be at an easier \n   stance than we are, I think we are, in fact, getting to the point where the connection between our tools and the state of the financial conditions is becoming much less clear. That being said, I have listened to President Bullard now for three or four meetings, and even I can begin to hear that after a while.",
    "I think that we should not rule out additional purchases. We might want to consider a program of modest purchases, which could be varied, and consider doing that in a way thats responsive to broad conditions and, specifically, to something that well learn a lot more about in the next few months, namely, what happens to the mortgage rate and the housing market after our purchases end.  So I think thats something we want to keep in mind as we think about our broad strategy. Should we do less, as an alternative? I think its good for confidence and good for predictability for us to begin to normalize policy, to begin to operate in a way that people are more familiar with.  We are coming to the point where we can do that, and I view this closing of some of these facilities as being an important step.  I dont think that actually tightening policy is a good idea, for the reasons I just said. I think that the economy is still quite weak and that we should not, at this point, either tighten or strongly signal a tightening at this juncture.   The signaling is very important. For example, relative to President Lackers and others suggestion about cutting back slightly on our purchases, the $100 billion here and there is small change, as far the magnitudes are concerned.  President Plosser is holding his forehead.",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have been discussing whether we should embark on a long-term Treasury purchase program or whether we should \n   engage in a greater magnitude or duration of agency MBS purchases.  I am not sure these really are the next and best escalation options.  Not surprisingly, I agree with the staff memterm Treasuries, since I helped write it.",
    "On asset purchases,",
    "I think there are lots of good reasons to escalate:  The economy is weaker; financial conditions are tighter; in addition, the TALF is off to a slow start because of all of the stuff thats swirling around on AIG and TARP. The broader TALF, I think, is going to come much later.  While there might be an announcement on legacy TALF relatively soon, the actual operationalization of that, I think, is going to take many monthsjust given that the TALF 1.0, which were enacting today, took four months.  And the PPIFits not even clear whether banks are going to be willing to sell assets to the PPIF. Are they going to get a high enough price to engage in those transactions?  So it seems to me that right now its on us.  And its more on us than it was even a few weeks ago, because I think the political climate has deteriorated significantly, so the ability of the Administration to go back to the Congress and get more TARP money is significantly less than it was even a few weeks ago. \n  Then the question is: What should we escalate to?  The lines in Davids graph suggest that $2 trillion would put us roughly on top of the unconstrained line.  And, conveniently, the numbers I was going to advocate total $2 trillion, by coincidence rather than by design.  We did not talk beforehand, as David can attest.",

    "I have a question about the brokered fed funds market versus the other. It seems as though we are a bit captured by the brokered fed funds market because that is where we have the rate information.  But couldnt we actually get the rate information on the bank-to-bank funds market if we really made an effort and because we regulate these entities?",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I just want to talk to some points that President Plosser raised about inflation expectations.  I completely agree that inflation expectations matter. I think we have to be careful, though, that our concern about \ninflation expectations does not imply to others that well be forced to take back accommodation sooner. On the inflation expectations front, we can actually make considerable progress by explaining to people clearly why we can exit. I thought it was interesting that everyone here has \nstipulated that we can exit, but I dont think that the market believes that everybody on this Committee believes that we can exit.  I think it would be helpful to the markets if we did explain \n that, and that would help keep inflation expectations more anchored.  I also think that we could help keep inflation expectations better anchored by explaining that we think inflation will be subdued given the large output gap. We can actually accomplish both goalsexplain our policy a little better and work at keeping inflation expectations anchored.  So I think communication is something that we need to continue to work on.  Weve made quite a bit of progress this summeryour speech and testimony, Mr. Chairman, on the exit strategy helped.  But I think the more people who are confident that we can manage our exit, the more helpful it will be on the inflation expectations front. Yesterday I was hoping to talk about large-scale asset purchases.",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Eighth District economy has generally performed better than the U.S. economy as a whole during the last two years.  Payroll employment nationally has declined about 5.4 percent since 2007, since the recession began.  In the District, for 16 metropolitan statistical areas, payroll employment has declined only about 3.7 percentbad to be sure but considerably better than the nation as a whole.  This generally extends across two-digit SIC codes.  One exception is education and health, which has actually grown 3.7 percent nationally during the same time period but has grown only 2.8 percent in the District metropolitan statistical areas. Very recent data on employment in the District, however, have been worse than in the nation as a whole, and were watching this very closely.  But the District data tend to be more volatile, as you might expect, and it is not clear at this point how meaningful they are, but I will report on that in the future. Eighth District unemployment is just over 9 percent in our sixteen MSAs.  Anecdotal reports indicateas many of you have noted and, Im sure, will notethat commercial real estate is a key concern.  The near-term outlook for this area is quite grim indeed.  Businesses are very reluctant to hire, and we are in an environment of continued business caution and continued caution on capital expenditures, in particular. \n           Nationally, I thought it was heartening to see the positive GDP growth number after four consecutive declines. I have actually seen only two positive numbers since joining the Committee.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Id like to focus my remarks on a suggested handling of the asset-purchase program going forward versus exclusive focus on interest rate movements as the next important policy choice for this Committee.  I have been disappointed by an overemphasis on interest rates in the markets versus discussion of the quantitative easing program.  I think that this reflects a hangover from a long period of time, 25 years or longer, when interest rate movements defined what this Committee was doing with regard to monetary policy, and that markets have not really fully adjusted to the fact that we have other tools in place that we can adjust to try to implement a stabilization policy.  Then at the end, Ill turn to a few comments on issues about the statement and alternative B. A broad description of monetary policy over the last year to my mind would go like this.  In December 2008, almost one year ago, we adopted our near-zero interest rate policy.  In January 2009, we naturally switched to a quantitative easing program focused primarily on agency MBS, which if Im not mistaken, the Chairman has described as relatively standard now around the world for many central banks.  And in March 2009, we made a dramatic expansion of that commitment, which were still living up to and which will not be completed until the first quarter of 2010.  The \n            quantitative easing program has been considered successful, and we saw some estimates yesterday.  I think we all understand that theres a lot of uncertainty around those estimates; nevertheless, I think it is generally considered to have been an effective program. When I talk about monetary policy, I try to exclude liquidity programs that I regard as lender-of-last resort responses to the crisis, such as swaps, the TAF, and commercial paper.  All those facilities that are now running down; they reached a peak of almost $1.5 trillion, but now are all winding down. So I consider those separately, and I consider the asset-purchase program to be the hallmark of our quantitative easing program.  This description suggests a certain logic, believe it or not, to current policy, which is to pursue interest rate targeting in normal times and to switch to quantitative easing if the zero bound is encountered.  And that suggests that the tightening sequence should go the other way:  gradually remove the quantitative easing and then raise rates later as appropriate, given the information that comes in on the economy. Now, I think one of the key problems from the point of view of the way the Committee is thinking right now is that we do not currently view our quantitative easing program in feedback rule form. There is some talk about it, but we dont really think in terms of adjusting the quantitative easing program one way or another in response to incoming data.  We more or less have the idea that were going to go to our limit that we set in March of last year and then were going to stay there and let it run off the balance sheet.  I do not think that that is an optimal policy.  We should begin to adjust that program going forward in 2010, and in particular, possibly sell some MBS as the first indication of a tightening move. So what are the advantages of proceeding in this direction? I see this as a softer way to tighten policy than making a funds rate move or even than changing the extended period language as described in the extra section in the Bluebook this time.  If we make any moves on the funds rate \n      target or really interest on reservesa phrase that used to be used around here was ringing the gongwere really making a loud statement that were now embarked on a tightening program.  People will immediately extrapolate a whole sequence of moves, and that will be a big event when it occurs. Maybe its a long way away, as Governor Kohn just said, but that would be a big move.  So if we did it this other way, which says, Okay, were going to gradually sell off some of the MBS, that would be softer.  Thats one point.   I also think it allows some optionality during our current period of near-zero interest rates.  We can adjust the quantitative easing program in response to incoming information. Possibly, very possibly, the news will not be good, and we might need to adjust in an upward direction.  Several people here have remarked about all the uncertainty.  I think we all have to keep in mind that theres just a giant amount of uncertainty around any forecast:  It could come in very badly next year, or it could come in very positively.  We dont know.  There are a lot of possibilities out there. Let me say I agree with President YeltsinYeltsin?",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will just make a couple of comments based on the discussion today. When it comes to the TALF, I find that I am of two minds.  I do think it will ultimately be useful for deploying important central bank liquidity in an attempt to provide more-accommodative conditions.  But I am concerned that we are picking winners throughout \nthis process. When you mention that we are going to consider CMBS, I am reminded of the fellow who came to my office and gave me a presentation.  He owns shopping malls, and last fall he desperately needed funding and still does, but they are not worth very much at the moment.  He wanted a program like this, but it wasnt availableI do not know that it was, anyway.  I have also received phone calls from heavy equipment manufacturers in my District.  I know you have gotten a letter from at least one of them about their finance company financing.  For them the issue is that they are unlucky enough not to have a thrift through the OTS.  So they cannot get the FDIC unsecured-funding temporary guarantee on that, and their assets cannot be funded that way. There are some competitors that have access to this, and they have done very well, and \nothers that havent. As we get into this allocation type of decisionmaking, I am not quite sure how we are going about doing it. Is CMBS selected because it is an important market that we \nneed to keep functioning or because it is going to have a particular macroeconomic effect that is beneficial?  How does that compare with other sectors and whether they are on our radar screen or not?  Maybe that was the right decision, but when we select certain types of asset-backed securities to buyit is just very difficult. \n  I also want to agree with many of the comments that President Plosser made with regard to the programs that we have.  The briefing today was very helpful in describing the various programs.  I think we need some additional metrics along the lines of just routine types of statistics so that we can see and have a better idea.  Your familiarity is very great with these, and ours is not as great. I have to admit, as I look at it more, I find that, although I am very concerned about exit strategy in general, at the moment our balance sheet doesnt worry me quite so much. Finally, I want to applaud your comments at the beginning, Mr. Chairman, about discussions with the Treasury and that we, as best we can be, should be allergic to any attempts to use our balance sheet for long-term financing.  I think that is exactly right.  I wish you all the best for all of us.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will resist the temptation to mark down my forecast right now.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Id like to congratulate you on being a tough taskmaster, with having us sit and listen to an hours worth of briefings without any questions.  I had seven, but Im down to three now.",
    "Yeah. It seems like a hope at the moment.  And Im not opposed to hoping a lot.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Much as President Yellen said, I think the best news today seems to be that, for once, the forecast has not deteriorated between FOMC meetings.  In fact, looking at, in the Greenbook, the evolution of the staff forecast, this is about the only noticeable time that the forecast has improved in the past year.  So thanks very much, Dave and your staff, for that.",
    "President Bullard just made a number of very interesting and stimulating comments, and I want to take just a slight exception. I thought that the rap on FRB/US was a bit too tough on the forecast. As I understand it, it is really more the Greenbook.  I agree with you that you have to know what you are trying to use the model forthe question that is being asked.  But I am hard-pressed to think of any model that would predict well during this period.  I think that these models are helpful for verifying our intuition in a disciplined fashion in response to a number of these issues. You pointed out that the MauskopfSim paper was useful, and that used FRB/US as well. So I just wanted to mention that. We have nudged up our forecast a bit, and there is not much distance between our projections and the Greenbook. The broad contours of that outlook seem consistent with what I \n am hearing from my directors and other business contacts.  They say that the pace of deterioration is slowing and report that the most dire scenarios now seem less likely.  Some of them had been close to making some major structural cutbacks but are now postponing those plans in the hope that they can be avoided completely. A couple of factors seem to underlie the modest improvement in the outlook of business people. One is that credit conditions are somewhat better.  This is evident in the spreads and other data that we looked at earlierthe Greenbooks financial factors indexesand in the rebound in equity markets.  Another factor is that, after all the cutting, the economys natural cyclical adjustment process is finally becoming evident.  Inventories have been slashed, and although many firms say that they have more cutting to do, they are at least to the point where they can imagine having stocks under control.  After that, they will need to increase production to keep up with demand.  In addition, in sectors, such as housing, that have had the most excess capacity, falling prices may be finally helping to stabilize demand.   That said, the improvement in tone is a relative one.  As President Bullard said, my conversations with business people are still dominated by reports of further declines in activity and extremely difficult business environments.  Whereas previously they talked as if the bottom was unimaginably far in the future, now they can see faint signs of its emergence.  I suppose in the Washington area this goes as green shoots.  Perhaps in Minneapolis it is referred to as the spring thaw. In Chicago, the Cubs are playing baseball, and it wont be long before they are thinking about next year.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ill take the points in the sequence that you mentioned. On Brians and the staffs facility recommendations, although I long for the day when we are comfortable with markets to the point of ending 13(3) authority, Im not bothered by the \n   individual programs.  I think theyre well put together, and I think the plan, as stated, is a good one. Frankly, I think markets will see the conditional statements in the release as indicating our willingness to keep the 13(3) authority for a time.  I wouldnt think that they would think were about to ramp it down, but well see. And I do think that ending 13(3) will be done appropriately, it will be positive, it will be a boost, much like the SCAP. On the exit strategies and the reserve management tools, much as President Yellen indicated, I tend to favor the tools that strengthen the interest on excess reserves mechanism, and there are a number of those that, put together, should strengthen the arbitrage.  Reverse RPs, I think, are also a good tool. If were looking to the money market funds as one source of liquidity, thats going to sort of alter the commercial paper market, since theyre a big source of funding there. And I just dont know what the implications are.  Wed want to understand expected dysfunction in that marketas opposed to unexpected dysfunctionto see what wed be doing there. But reverse RPs are quite good, I think. On the comment that we should try to project complete confidence in our ability to do this, mostly I agree with that.  My first reaction is that youve actually talked quite a lot about exit strategies already. And in your Q&A with the Congress, Im not exactly sure how much of what you intend to say will be new.  Just your saying it is newsworthy of course.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just wanted to ask you a question.  Taking note of the extremely large range on the inflation forecast for core PCE, is this outside of historical experience? I dont mean the history of our projectionswe havent been doing it that long. But have we seen this kind of range among professional forecasters, even taking note of \nthe fact that they might want to market their forecasts in a particular way because theyve got different jobs than we do?  It seems very large, and, frankly, it challenges your ability to listen to \nall of the commentary around the room in an even-keeled way, it seems to me.  Well, thats my reactionspeaking of shipping.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast has not changed materially.  I guess we were a little ahead of the Greenbook.  We are still looking for GDP growth to average about 3 percent over the next six quarters and then pick up to a pace more noticeably above potential in 2011. Virtually all of my directors and business contacts reported continued improvement and modest firming of recent positive developments.  Clearly, the evidence that the recovery is underway is getting stronger each month.  But many contacts also offered another more guarded flavor of commentary, probably along the lines of what President Fisher said.  Now that the fear of a truly awful outcome has receded, businesses are increasingly coming to grips with the realization that, even though recovery is under way, its likely to be a slow one, with the unemployment rate remaining high for some time.  The weak labor market will weigh on their customers confidence, businesses planning, and the strength and momentum of near-term expansion.  This guardedness is a natural reaction to events.  By itself, I dont think its an independent cause for concern, but its something to be mindful of. I will just touch quickly on some of the high points from my economic reports.  Inventory restocking is clearly under way and is boosting production.  The implications for hiring are mixed.  The business segments that were hardest hit cut employment most deeply, and now we are bringing back some workers as they increase utilization.  But most others who cut less deeply are not hiring yet.  Many business contacts stated that the recoverys momentum will be most \nuncertain in the first half of 2010 following the inventory restocking.  Reports of improvements \nin financial and credit conditions were widespread.  Several contacts involved in commercial real estate markets even reported substantial progress.  All in all, my discussions seemed consistent with an economy expected to grow for 18 months at a pace of about 3 percent.  This tepid growth \n   is from the bottom of a very deep recession and leaves the unemployment rate remaining above 9 percent during this phase of the recovery. While there does not seem to be much disagreement over this outlook for the economy, I continue to be surprised by the lack of agreement over the implications of the resulting measures of resource slack for inflation. So lets see what I can add here.  I think I understand the arguments implicit in last weeks communications from Presidents Plosser and Lacker on the Bluebook policy alternatives, as well as some public commentary about resource slack.  These arguments I think of roughly like this.  First, theory says inflation is a monetary phenomenon.  I think we all agree with that. Second, resource slack has tenuous and arguable implications for inflation and is measured with great uncertainty.  And, finally, many economists reject resource slack implications because of these concerns. But its an enormous leap to ignore entirely all measures of resource slack.  Output gaps are not unique in being unobservable and difficult to measure.  Inflation expectations are very important and are equally unobservable, heterogeneous, and the measures often are in conflict.  Just look at variations in liquidity in the TIPS markets for the compensation measures that we look at. If you look carefully at the Michigan survey and think about how the survey participants respond, there are biases, the data are censored and massaged quite a lotwe know we cant get \nthe levels of inflation expectations right, either.  As I looked at inflation expectations data in Part 2 of the Greenbook, the Survey of Professional Forecasters had 2.2 percent for ten years ahead, Michigan had 2.9, the TIPS at the five-year five-year had 2.9.  And these are all greater than our implicit target of 2 percent, but when I look at the charts they have been there for quite some time.  So getting the levels is really tough, and looking at changes in inflation expectations is a bit of a dodge in the same way that we take the resource slack as given when we look at it. \n  Now, of course, the signal-to-noise ratios on our measures of resource slack are normally low; that is, noise is large.  But currently all measures of slack are pointing in the same direction with large magnitudes. The unemployment rate is just about 10 percent, so the signal-to-noise ratio is much better right now.  Just as importantly, I think that without the idea of substantial resource slack, its hard to understand what has been happening to inflation and inflation expectations. Hypothetically, if the economys need for structural adjustments explains all or most of the drop in employment and output, then why arent inflation expectations very high and rising?  In that scenario, the enormous growth in the monetary base would mean monetary policy is extraordinarily accommodative.   So something else must be keeping inflation expectations reasonably stable, another unobservable factor. Is our credibility particularly high today? Our legion of critics doesnt believe that. And if I believed that resource slack was minimal, and then looked at our balance sheet, I wouldnt think so either. Although Im surprised that inflation expectations havent fallen more, I strongly suspect the reason that they have stayed moderate in the face of massive monetary easing is that the public sees equally massive amounts of resource slack and expects that slack to eliminate most price pressures. I share in calls for additional language and metrics to express the FOMCs markers on inflation pressures.  I think that those comments are right on target.  Such additional conditions \nwould help guide us and communicate to the public our ability and resolve to keep inflation and inflation expectations well behaved.  But currently I dont have any hesitation in including resource slack in this list of markers.  It makes it tougher going back to my alma mater and talking to my advisors, but",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B.  It seems that this is the most disparate set of commentary Ive heard on policy alternatives.  Its a very interesting meeting, and I hope I can add to that spirit.",

    "First, Mr. Chairman, I think this may be the first time that a Wellesley woman has had responsibility for the Trading Desk.  I am married to a Wellesley woman.  I am used to being tutored by a Wellesley woman.",
    "I do want just to jump in.  I thought your response was appropriate and correct, and obviously ultimately we would like to put as much of this back to the Treasury as possible. The ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible from political pressures, so we can do what central bankers do.  I might also add as much as possible from market pressures, but that is another matter.  But I disagree with the point made and I agree with the staff conclusionwith regard to the purchase of Treasuries.  It strikes me that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy.  I am very reluctant to go down that road.  That strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the staff made.  At any rate, at this point I dont think it is necessary.  Rates are quite low as they are.  I disagree, Jeffrey, in ideal market situations, as the Vice Chairman just pointed outwhatever you are of this Committee",
    "Mr. Chairman, Mr. Plosser said he would take a more optimistic view to make the distribution complete.  I was going to say that I am going to take the opposite tack, but \nPresident Yellen pretty much summarized what I was about to say.  I do want to comment on my District, and second, I want to talk very briefly about microeconomic behavior based on my discussions with various CEOs around the country26 this time.  Mr. Chairman, you have the list of who they are outside my District. First, with regard to our District, like President Hoenigs, our two Districts, I believe, are the only ones that had positive employment growth last year.  In the Eleventh District, we \n   created 192,400 jobs, according to our adjusted data, all in the private sector.  That machine has stopped; in fact, we would have a straight line downward if we were to chart it.  Manufacturing, chemicals, commercial construction, energy, and transportation services have reported significant drops in demand.  Oil and gas prices have fallen, as I think we are all well aware.  The rig count has come down accordingly.  Just for clarification purposes, the oil and gas industry accounts for 10 percent of our employment; nonetheless, it is a significant factor.  Our high-tech industry is under pressure. I think anybody who read the newspaper saw Texas Instruments recent numbers.  They are reflective of what is going on in that sector.  Exports, which are important, have been particularly hit hard by declining growth in external markets.  We are the largest exporting state. Our exports have declinedinterestingly, because of the stronger dollar but also because of the weakness overseas that you mentioned, President Bullard.  Our largest industry in terms of employment, our medical industry, is suffering in terms of foreigners who come to be repaired in Houston, Dallas, and elsewhere. So our District, like President Hoenigs District, has now fallen into recession, and we are like everybody elsefor the most part (we still are Texans).",
    "I will refrain this time around, Mr. Chairman, from referring to Rube Goldberg, Bennie and the Jets, and Elton John. But I do want to recall what I consider to be a prescient insight of James Madison, who said, The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money. When I speak to CEOs around the country, I would say that confidence is not just waning, it is in a freefall. It is leading me to conclude that, obviously, their behavior is becoming hard-over pro-cyclical, and the consequences are the kind of serious recessionary scenario that President Yellen pointed out and significantly higher deflationary risks. I think that negative outlook, particularly the outlook for deflation, is the 800-pound gorilla or, my having just come \nback from the Galapagos, the 800-pound blue-footed booby in the room.  And I dont think we should be shy to talk about it. Businesses are doing what they should be doingwhat you and I would do or what any woman or any man who runs a business would do under the circumstances.  They are aggressively cutting head count. One of the CEOs I talked to, who employs one of the largest workforces in the country, said he had three drawers.  In the one drawer he plans to cut 17,000 jobs, unannounced as yet; in a drawer to the right of that, a still higher number; and in a drawer to the right of that, a still higher number.  I asked about the drawers to the left, and he said, There are none. Even businesses that are well run and well capitalized are doing, again, what any businesswoman or businessman would do under the circumstances.  If they are in good shape, which are few, they are using this as a chance to cull out the kind of legacy middle management they have been waiting to get rid of for some time.  Therefore, the bias is to lower head counts. We saw pretty dramatic numbers announced one day or two days ago, and I think that is intensifying, not lessening. They are implementing pay and merit freezes. They are stretching out their payables. I dont know if this is public or not, but GE has gone around to their major suppliers and asked for forbearance on payablesGE, AAA-rated credit, whom we are assisting at this time.  They are aggressively pursuing their receivables, particularly the law firms and other service-sector firms.  They are running their plant and equipment at the lowest levels in some time.  TI is running its factories at 33 percent of capacity. The Eastman chemical plant in Tennessee is running at the lowest capacity utilization in over 100 years. You see this, again, across the board.  On the rails, there are 100,000 cars that are unutilized. And to go back to my favorite metric of the 70-foot-long lumber-carrying cars, there are 285 miles of unutilized cars of that nature across the rail industry.  Very critically, they \nare cutting back dramatically on cap-ex.  Not a single CEO I spoke to, from Disney to the large manufacturers, is doing anything but.  The least amount of cutback that I heard was 12 percent, and the average, I would say, is up to a third. So, in my view, the Greenbook base case has understated the effect of this dynamic.  My outlook is probably the most pessimistic of all of the Banks.  I am line number 8, for those of you who are guessing. We all know, by the way, who line number 18 is, because it says, New York says this; New York says that; New York says this.",
    "I just want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the spirit in which we have conducted these conversations in this meeting.  As you know, at least of some of us felt that we might be disenfranchised.  You may be enfranchising us too much.",
    "May I just take this opportunity to welcome Governor Tarullo on board and give him an option to leave if he decides to do so.",
    "It just seems to me we are going throughthis is a comment, and it, again, may be based on ignorancea lot of jujitsu here to get around the issue of creating a good bankbad bank, taking the toxic assets in the bad bank and clearing it in that way.  The TALF is becoming inordinately complicated.  And I guess, if youll forgive a horrible pun, Im worried \n   TALF is getting too clever by HALF.",
    "I was first going to say to Dave Stockton that our wives have an affinity for T-shirts. My wife, a smart Wellesley woman who spent most of her time at MIT, arrived at Oxford noting that the ratio of women to men was 1 to 11.  She had a T-shirt for other women which she sold briskly, and it said, Come to Oxford where the odds are good, but the goods are odd.",
    "Mr. Chairman, I want to report on the microeconomic input I received from my corporate contacts, which numbered some 29 CEOs around the country whom I talked to before this meeting.  Unfortunately, it confirms what Dave and Steve presented.  In fact, one actually called \nme and said, Do you want some good news? And I said, Please.  He said, Call somebody else.",
    "As to our District, we have fallen finally into recession.  We created jobs last year.  I believe we are the only District that did create jobs last year, or had jobs created in the District.  The cut is less severeit will take fewer stitches to mendbut, nonetheless, we have been cut. As to the national economy, my favorite indicators are all negative.  There are 175,000 railcars that are out of commission. There has been some improvement in bulk shipping rates, but that is a head fake according to shippers I have talked to, because of the extraordinary purchase of iron ore that China undertook recentlyin fact, record amounts.  If you look at containers and other shipping indicators, these are all flat to negative.  Of the worlds large aircraft fleet, 20 percentthats 2,800 airplanesare now sitting unused in the desert.  If you look at Boeings numbers, it received only four orders for new aircraft versus several hundred last February. And Im told by my contacts in the airline industry that the Chinese government has ordered all of their carriers not to take the liberty of buying a single plane in 2009.  That from one of the largest net new buyers of aircraft in the world. \n    There is very little cap-ex taking place. In fact, every corporate contact I spoke to, from the large manufacturers to even Disney, is cutting back on cap-ex and displaying all kinds of microeconomic behavioral patterns that indicate the kind of deflationary trap that my colleague just spoke about. Weve talked about them before, but the essence is they are withholding decisions. Theyre withholding decisions because they hope to get it done cheaper later.  Theyre also withholding decisions because they are confused.  And you see this in some of the data from those that touch many consumers in the country, as well.  For example, according to AT&T, its large enterprise business has just stopped; its small business demand is in decline; its 800 services are down. And, very interestingly, overall minutes are declining significantly.  One of the indications of movement of people is roaming minutes.  Roaming minutes domestically and internationally, according to the CEO of AT&T, have come to a screeching halt. The picture is similar if you talk to people in the travel and entertainment business, which I do like to look at. If you aggregate it properly, not just airline travel, not just hotels, but sports and entertainment and all that derives from it, its a significantly sized industry.  According to Disneys CEO, travel and entertainment is down 46 percent year-over-year in February.  Thats confirmed by the number of credit card transactions, which are up, but the total amount is down.  \nAccording to the CEO of JCPenney, whom Im fortunate to have on my board, this is going to manifest itself in further contraction, with particular risk in the commercial real estate area.  The chairman of the retail federation estimates that, of 1,100 major malls in the United States, a third will fail over the course of the next three years.  This is not happy news.  Part of it has to do with the lack of debtor-in-possession financing. Without DIP financing, you accelerate the process.  And I dont know how we are ever going to deal with that situation. \n I couldnt find any silver linings.  There is, I suppose, a pewter lining, as I like to call it.  And, Governor Tarullo, without any insult to your industry, one of the virtues is that the legal industry is also contracting",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, to state the obvious:  Were at the zero bound, were resorting to extraordinary tools to offset the deflationary and other consequences of overly tight monetary policy, and we have to deploy that extraordinary tool kit effectively, deliberately, and with clarity. President Lockhart injected a little humor by congratulating you on your having an interchange named after you and pointing out there is an off-ramp.  There is no off-ramp right now, unfortunately.  And President Pianalto pointed to your 60 Minutes performance, which I also wanted to applaud, except to point out there was one weakness:  You were opposite George Clooney in that time slot.",
    "What a nice way to celebrate my birthday.",
    "With people I greatly respect, and I just want to say I hope I live to be as old as Don Kohn.",
    "Mr. Chairman, I want to start out talking about the Texas manufacturing report. As you know, I dont often talk about my District.",
    "Because we do produce a large share of total manufacturing goods in the United States, I want to point out that the report we released yesterday indicated pretty much what I am hearing from CEOs around the country.  \n   That is, the indexes for production, capacity utilization, and volume of new orders and shipments edged upward for the second consecutive month, but our firms are reporting that job cuts exceed hires by a 10 to 1 margin, and 36 percent of the firms noted a decline in work hours.  That said, the six-month outlook turned positive for the first time since June 2008, reflecting either wishful thinking or quite probably a sense that firms have battened down the hatches, have a better sense of their vulnerabilities, and have a better sense of visibility vis--vis the budgeting that they have now ratcheted down, and I think that may account for some of this optimism. So I would not point to a silver lining.  It is what I call a pewter lining, slightly better than it was before. That is confirmed by the comments I received from the CEOs to whom I talked after I got back from Chinanot very many, but hopefully indicative.  But here are the lukewarm responses that I got in talking to some of them.  For example, the head of the National Retail Federation, who sits on my board and runs JCPenneyI love this one:  I never thought flat would look so good was his comment.",
    "Still negative, but a slightly better tone. From the CEO of Wal-Mart, seeing a little more discretionary spending, Its soft but not accelerating.  Shifting over to an entirely different sector, the CEO of Disney:  Early signs that deterioration is starting to slow. And from the CEO of Exxon looking, as I like to do, at the chemicals, lubricants, asphalt, and other possible leading indicatorsor at least indicators in terms of where the stimulus package may be hitting the road:  There werent any places where things got worse. The only place where I could find that things had gotten worse was in the rails. Shipments are down 19 percent year to date. I think that reflects mainly coal and a shift to natural gas at these cheap prices for electricity consumption.  I do note, if you look at the Edison Electric data through April 18, that weekly electricity output is still declining.  So there may be \n some green shoots, but Id like to say that there are no sparks in terms of that kind of indicator activity. I am going to focus the remainder of my remarks on the impressions gained from my trip from April 6 to April 22 to Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, and Seoul, with a focus on China. First, I would like to preface it by saying that here at home all of the Bank Presidents have their views, but Im not sure thats understood by the public.  We always say it, but abroad nobody understands that distinction. As I told you, Mr. Chairman, before I left for the trip, I stuck to the party line, remembering the old definition that a diplomat is someone who is sent abroad to lie for their country.",
    "I was just extremely diplomatic, faithfully toed the line, and just basically listened very carefully.  Here is what I heard. With regard to Japan, we have seen their latest projections for the fiscal year that has starteddown 3.1 percent following an equally awful year last year.  In addition to visiting at length with the Commissioner of the FSA and Governor Shirakawa, as I mentioned earlier, and the staff, I met with several CEOs. I have been going there since 79.  I would say that I had never seen them this pessimistic, I think largely because 22 percent of the economy is manufacturing and 40 percent of that is the auto industry in one form or another.  And their demographics are awful.  Industrial production is down 30 percent.  The last time that happenedI think I may have mentioned this at the last meetingwas when Godzilla destroyed Tokyo in a movie in 1954. So there is definitely a mood of extreme pessimism in Japan, and I found that very discouraging. The situation in Singapore is different. It is worse in terms of the short term.  The first-quarter performance is down 19 percent for GDP.  Ports are inactive.  But Lee Kuan Yew and his successors are planning for tapping into China. And quickly to skip over to Koreathat was the \n one place in which I didnt feel like a dartboard or receiver of spears in that the timeliness of our foreign exchange swap really was helpful, and they are most grateful.  Their own ship seems to be floating a little better, and the economy seems to be stabilizing somewhat. I want to focus on China.  I met with the requisite what they call barbarian handlers, which includes Yi Gang and the CBRC Commissioner and the China Investment Corporation people. I also met with the nonbarbarian handlers, quite a few who are just purely internal, both in politics and in business. Here is the take-home:  They reported 6.1 percent economic growth for the first quarter. I am always amazed at the alacrity with which they report their numbers.  Kind of like Radar on MASH, they seem to know the number before the quarter is over.",
    "I did find out, Mr. Chairman, where the 8 percent came from.  That is that Deng Xiaoping asked in 1980 what it would take to quadruple the economy by the year 2000, and the answer was 8 percent compounded. That is where the 8 percent comes from.  It is reported all the way upfrom the governors on up.  But as far as this 6.1 percent figure, Nathan, if you look at their importexport activity for the first quarter, exports were down 18 percent, imports were down 70 percent on an arithmetic measured basis.  And their electrical output is continuing to decline. It declined 5 percent in the first quarterour fourth quarter and through the first quarterand there just is no correlation currently, although it has been very high historically, between GDP growth and electricity consumption and output.  But currently their electricity output is significantly lagging the numbers they are reporting for economic growth. Second, with regard to the Peoples Bank of China and the CBRC, they reported that lending has focused on squeezing out excess capacity.  That seems to be their objective, and this was repeated by several of the business leaders.  They also feel that the budgeted amount they had planned for this calendar year all has been lent out in January and February, with some \n  excess floating into the securities markets, particularly the equity market.  The concern that we picked up was, for the third quarter, fourth quarter, and into next year, that basically the thrust of the fiscal package and the guidance they have given for lending, which is extending beyond the formal banking system to the trust banks and these new private banks, is basically taking place currently and might not have the kind of follow-through that they hope to see.   The bottom line is that they cannot re-gear their economy very quickly.  They are still dependent on the United Statessignificantlyand on Europe.  That is 42 percent of their export activity.  The bottom line of that is that their reserves will build more slowly.  Still, they have no choice but to focus on U.S. dollars and Treasuries in terms of their investment and a small amount of mortgage-backed securities.  They are seeking a greater role for their currency through their swap lines and through their trade invoicing in Hong Kong and some of the other major cities.  So it is unremarkable that (a) they have deep concerns about the value of their Treasury debt and (b) fewer concerns about their agency holdings.  I could have told them that we decided to purchase $5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.  It didnt seem that it would have had much impact.  But their concerns were constant.  In every single meeting, in more than 40 meetings, they did not once fail to mention that they were concerned about our purchasing Treasuries and that they were skeptical about our ability to pull off a successful withdrawal of liquidity when the time comes. I want to conclude by reading from the April 20 issue of the China Daily. The same article appeared in the Peoples Daily in Chinese. The former Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan said, The U.S. Federal Reserves recent purchase of its Treasury bonds, which effectively prints new money, is likely to turn the budget deficit into inflation.  That will lead to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and cause a major loss in Chinas foreign exchange reserves.  And the depreciation \nof the dollar has become an inevitable historical trend.  So it is a frisky place, and they are booming relative to everybody else.  But I basically would put that message under a subtitle of what I call Malice in Wonderland.",
    "Mr. Chairman, youre going to hear some similarity to what you just heard from Governor Warsh and President Plosser.  I agree with most of the statements that were made.  I feel particularly strongly about the issue of the Treasuries.  As Governor Warsh mentioned, Im beyond particularly uncomfortable, I am especially uncomfortable.  I think \ntheres no evidence that it has a positive impact.  We can tell ourselves and we can tell the marketplace that, indeed, the corporate debt market has improved.  Im rather pleased with that; obviously, we all are. Im not sure theres direct causality, but I do think the risk-return tradeoff is way too negative. Even if we figure out a cute way to say it, there still is a suspicion that were monetizing deficits, although weve been much firmer in our public statements on that.  And I realize that in chart 4 thats just a somewhat important factor, but it is a factor, and I worry about that. \n I want to come back to Brians recommendations.  I think we have to be very careful that were not perceived as basically providing facilities to prop up institutions that are too big to fail at the expense of other institutions that desire to grow.  In my earlier remarks, I used the wrong term.  I said political, and I meant opticalI think the optics are rather poor.  If TAF is being used, as was pointed out in the staff paper, principally or significantly by two institutions that are too big to fail, I think we have to be careful about that.  President Plosser made a suggestion that we might limit it even more severely in terms of the amounts; I think he was suggesting a pricing impact there.  Obviously, classical central banking is to lend at a penalty rate. But that penalty rate is a gift compared to what we would be charging smaller and regional banks. Therefore, I would ask you to go through the list and think of which of these facilities are really in place to prop up institutions that are too big to fail.  And I would be curious as to which of those facilities you consider as actually having an impact there and as helpful on that front and which are not.  But I reiterate my concerns about the optics of TAF and the primary credit recommendations.   On the issue of exiting, obviously the market is asking for it.  Everybodys asking for it. I do think the Monetary Policy Report, Mr. Chairman, is the appropriate vehicle, and, perhaps, your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Like President Plosser, I personally am uncomfortable with Fed bills.  I dont think it is politically feasible. The staff points that out. I worry about the market that would be made in those and the derivatives that would be written from them.  I have spoken to that before, but I dont think that is a particularly wise recommendation to make. \n   I will make one last recommendation, only half in jest, which is that we get rid of the TALF program and we call that the Bill Nelson Relief Act.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I recently accompanied my wife to a board meeting of the American Film Institute, of which she is a director, in President Yellens District in Hollywood, and to prepare for that trip I read Evelyn Waughs wonderful novel The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy. The plot line is about a minor British poet who goes to write \n the greatest movie of all time about the life of Percy Shelley and settles for employment at a pet cemetery called The Happy Hunting Ground.  Theres a precious scene in that novel where the tough head of the film studio is surrounded by people around a table and in the back benches.  The people around the table are described as yes men and those on the back benches as nodders. I find myself nodding and saying yes",
    "to everything that has been said by my predecessors at this table.  There is a unanimity of view, it seems to me, that, as President Yellen just pointed out, the economy is bottoming out, but it is a gradual and fragile recovery, and it will take a long time to regain employment.  I forecast an almost checkmark-shaped recovery, which is a long recovery, as President Rosengren stated, with the unemployment rate masking some of the problems we have with our workforce, and I do not foresee a very quick recovery. What concerns me is that the people that I talk to, the CEO list that I give you, and even the people we talked to in that part of the country, which is not known for being plugged into reality, also have a unanimous view. I want to touch on two aspects that were mentioned by my predecessors here. The first is with regard to President Rosengrens point that unemployment may be masking deeper problems.  Even in your District, President Rosengren, I noticed that Harvard Law School just sent out a letter recommending that their graduating class seek employment in other fieldsperhaps at pet cemeteries; Im not quite sure.",
    "Also Heaven Can Wait.",
    "Mr. Chairman, if I may, before I make my comment, I do want to thank Gary for his service. I have a friend who turned 107 and who died the other day.  When he turned 100,",
    "he ran Kidder Peabody in 1931being a great stock picker, he said it would split two for one. Gary, even if you split two for one, you would still have the shortest interventions of anybody at this table and probably the pithiest.  You will be seriously missed. I would like to start out by talking a little about what we see in the data, and then I would like to provide a summary of what I gleaned from my corporate contacts.  Then given the \ntaxonomy that Mr. Wessel has imposed on this table, I am going to conclude with a comment about balls. First, on the data in terms of our District, we are seeing significantly better signs about stabilization. Our initial claims for unemployment insurance are declining.  Our housing industry, which wasnt suffering as much as others, has experienced an uplift.  Our single-family permits were up 13 percent year over year in June; existing home sales were up 3 percent.  And other than President Pianaltos District, we had the best CaseShiller performance, I think from a slightly higher base, in the recent numbers that were reported.  As the leading exporting state, we are taking some succor in the data that are coming out.  Our exporting activity is getting less bad, but it is still not positive.  And from our own calculation of leading indicators at the Dallas Fed, we have seen three months of increase after nine months of decrease.  So from the narrow perspective of our District, we are encouraged to see some stabilization.   I think the national picture has been well covered by the presentations that were made, with one exception. We dont quite share your relative pessimism about the bounceback in economic growth.  We can expect, over the next few quarters perhaps, a little more aggressive activity.  It is really when we deemphasize the negatives and accentuate the positives, as I like to say, and get a boost from inventory investment and government purchase.  Nonetheless, both of those will be assuredly temporary.  It is what happens after that that we are concerned about.  So I would say from the standpoint of my District and from what we are seeing in the data nationally, if you will forgive a bad joke, it is a slightly brighter shade of beigenot tremendously exciting but nonetheless improved from what we saw before. In terms of CEO contactsand the Chairman has my listjust to comment, Brian, on your presentation, particularly your slide number 2 with regard to corporate earnings.  By my \ncalculations, so far 443 of the S&P 500 have reported.  Of the 419 nonfinancials that reported, revenuesI am not talking about earnings but revenuesare down 19.1 percent versus 4.6 percent for the 24 financials that have reported.  This is the third double-digit quarterly decline in sales, and the previous quarter was the second back to back that we have seen since 1965. It seems to me, if I were to summarize the one theme I am hearing from my CEO contacts, that it would be that there is too much of everything relative to demand for the foreseeable future. There are too many ships at sea.  And speaking of the Chinese, as you know they are becoming a building power.  I talked about this many, many months, if not a couple of years ago, at this table. They expect, according to some shippers I talked to, to deliver up to 40 percent of the existing global fleet in 2010, 2011, and 2012. There are too many railroad cars.  There are 507 miles, Mr. Chairman, of unused mothballed railroad cars now in the United States, 5,280 feet in a mile, and each car is 90 feet long. I will let you do the math.  But the point is we are not going to build a railroad car in this country for years. There are too many airplanes; there are too many homes; there are too many hotels, too many office buildings, and too many retail stores and malls.  There are 145,000 convenience stores in this country, and the operators of those companies all expect to rationalize significantly. There is too much oil. And to give you a number that comes from Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon, there are 120 million barrels of floating inventory.  That is the highest he can recall in his experience. There are 3 trillion square feet of natural gas on the ground.  We have not before, to anybodys knowledge that I have been able to find out, had this high an inventory count this early in the year. And the resource wells and these narrow wellsthat is, like the Barnett Shalehave to be counted as reserves as well. \n   There is too much corn. There is even too much polyester.",
    "As Governor Tarullo points outand he and I watch the same television shows; we were raised on Saturday Night Livethere has always been too much polyester.  But the Chinese are now bidding down their prices 5 to 6 percent for the fashion year that starts at the end of this year. So capacity is vast. Cap-ex will remain subdued.  As to head countand the point that President Evans was making earlier about employmentmany, many business people I talk with report that they have cut to the bone. But they also report that, not surprisingly, their workforce is much more productive than it was before, perhaps driven by fear of losing their jobs and benefits. They realize that, at least for the immediate term, these business operators can drive their businesses with fewer workers than they had assumed.  So most remain in a defensive crouch. Most are focused on cost containment.  They are driving their margins, but they are struggling to grow their top line. I would just conclude with my earlier reference to balls:  We seem to have to stay on the balls of our feet becauseI am sure you are relieved about that reference",
    "I guess what concerns me is that these monies are languishing in the system.  Theyre unlent and theyre unmultiplied.  And, again, here we have differentiation in the market.  We have been worried about whenjust to use an ugly analogythis giant fur ball finally gets released from this big pipe.  Were worried about a way to neutralize it.  But meanwhile its lying fallow in a sense, from the standpoint of people that want to borrow, assuming theres loan demand.  If you go through each one of your boxes, we dont know how much buffer people want over regulatory norms no increase in lending.  Mr. Lacker pointed out no change in lending terms and standards.  I guess, again, like President \nPlosser, I may be a dunce on this one.  Im not saying youre a dunce, Charles.",
    "Its a Nike swoosh.",
    "Ive gone drinking with Janet.  Shes no Yeltsin.",
    "Mr. Chairman, I submitted comments on September 16.  Many of them were incorporated in the statement.  I dont want to repeat myself.  I assume, Brian, they are somewhere in the record. Someone at the end of the table mentioned Hamlet and the Prince earlier, and it brought to mind the debate over the B-2 bomber, which was B-2 or not B-2, that is the question.",
    "Mr. Chairman, at our last meeting I portrayed our economic outlook from the Dallas perspective for the nation.  It resembled a checkmark, as you may remember, with a snapback in the third and fourth quarters, in the 3-plus percent range, before settling into a lower-shaped grade on the elongated side of the checkmark.  And you asked, I presume at the time only partially tongue in cheek, whether I was talking about that or a square root sign.  So I have given that a great deal of thought in the interim.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As pointed out by First Officer Murdoch and his shipmate, Nathan Sheets,",
    "we have seen some rather startling economic data recentlya less negative unemployment report, just to take President Rosengrens interpretation, and some indications of improved consumer dynamics and a much improved international \neconomic growth scene.  Financial markets, I think, are robust.  Key spreads have continued to narrow. Weve had some major announcements regarding TARP repayments and some \nsignificant nonfinancial transactions involving firms mainly in my District, for example, Buffetts acquisition of Burlington Northern and Exxons deal with TXO announced yesterday.  These developments are encouraging.  They indicate to me the recovery is under way. \n But Im still in a trust but verify mode, mainly based on the anecdotal evidence that Im picking up, which is mixed, from my contacts.  Im beginning to detect a faint demand-pull heartbeat among bulk shippersair freight operators like UPS and Federal Express and the rails.  Long-distance telephone usage is up slightly year over year.  Thats always an interesting sign, in this case driven by call center activity. And yet the retailers report sequential slippage month over month and year over year for December thus far, with Wal-Mart and Penneys especially concerned about the bottom three income quartiles for Christmas and for the first half of the year. Pricing power, as I think Dennis just referred to, eludes producers in most sectors.  Retailers who look back at their Black Friday actisensitive consumption, although I would note that the two large express shippers have announced increases in prices coming on January 4.  The announced number is 4 percentif you look at the way thats practiced, it will probably be a net rate of 2 percent.  And there are reports that Wal-Mart and other large merchants are using a little bit of pricing power in order to protect their margins. One worrisome development that I have heard about is in retail supply.  Chinese suppliers to retailers are attempting to renegotiate the price concessions for soft goods for 2010.  Most of the merchants report that they have rebuffed them, but they do not believe they can continue to hold off doing so into the second half of 2010 and 2011, as Chinese manufacturers margins are being squeezed by increasing labor costs, raw material costs, and inflation.  And the expectations are for a reversal in sign from a minus 3 to 4 percent for soft goods to plus 3 to 5 percent as we proceed through the second half of 2010, assuming that consumption holds up. \n On the balance sheet front, I could detect no change in this go-round with my interlocutors.  The capital markets are pretty much wide open to the big boys who are still hoarding cash. Most, with the exception of energy companies, such as Exxon, which are focused on longer-term natural gasa play that they consider defensiveare sitting on large cash reserves. Few are expecting to expand their cap-ex domestically until both the political and economic skies are clear. As to the small guys, they continue to complain about the paucity of bank credit.  As to budgeting head count and other operating overhead for 2010, the new ubiquitous buzzwords are ZOG and NOG. The bias is towards ZOG, which is zero overhead growth, or NOG, which is negative overhead growth.  This will not likely change until they see the whites of the eyes of \ntop-line growth in their revenues. It remains elusive.  Those who do see it are pursuing what is known in the parlance of consulting as the HOG approach, which is budgeting their overhead to half the overhead growth they would otherwise commit to, because of gnawing uncertainty and a newfound ability to drive higher productivity.  Thats the big business crowd.   The little guys, the small businesses, remain in a very defensive crouch.  Small businesses inventory investment plans are at historically low levels.  Their capital spending is on hold. Actual outlays and planned outlays are at record low levels.  More small firms, according to what I can glean, still plan on reducing employment than plan on adding to their \npayrolls. And as you have pointed out, Mr. Chairman, this is vexing, because we all know that, during recoveries, small firms typically account for a large share of employment gains.  Weve done some research on this at the Dallas Fed.  In each of the 1983-1984, 1993, and 2003 expansions, the vast majority of employment gains were generated by firms with fewer than 500 employees.  What we dont know is the degree to which cap-ex expansion of the larger firms \n drives that growth in employment in smaller firms.  For example, El Paso Natural Gas has just announced financing for a pipeline. It will add 5,000 employees to its own payroll, but in building that pipeline, of course, you feed into the small businesses that provide the supplies to those employees and the construction of that pipeline.  To the extent that smaller firms are more reliant on bank finance, its obvious that their recuperative powers are being affected by tight bank credit. As to the larger firms that have come to access financial markets rather readily and are less constrained by bank financing, they still appear, according to my interlocutors, reluctant to expand overhead and especially agnostic as to the need yet to expand domestic payrolls. I will just add to what several presidents have already mentioned by using a specific reference. A CEO just came back from touring the world.  This is a company that supplies ten million small businesses with a vital component on the IT side, and his response after the trip was, Every country I went toIndia, China, The Czech Republic, Brazil, Vietnamsaid, What can we do for you? How can we help you?  Well give you low taxes.  Well give you a building. Well give you land.  I come back here and its, You cant do this, you cant do that, you cant do this, you cant do that. That attitude, Mr. Chairman, is definitely having a \ndepressive effect. It has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it is holding back the desire to expand payroll and cap-ex and adding to the ZOG and to the NOG. As to the price pressure front, headline CPI rates have been increasing steadily these past few months.  The 12-month headline rate will soon turn positive, maybe with tomorrows report.  The Empire State data released today or yesterday indicate some building price pressure on what comes in the door, despite the weakness that was in that report.  Both core CPI and core PCE posted annualized one-month rates above 2 percent in October, and the 12-month rates have \n  ticked up to a little over 1.7 percent.  The direction of change from negative to positive might ordinarily ruffle a hawks feathers, but for now I remain unalarmed.  In part this is because of what accounts for the increase:  excise taxes on tobacco sales and a number of small items that are a bit obscure to me, other than the prices of new motor vehicles, such as the price index for consumption expenditures for nonprofit institutions, and two other dodgy financial service components, the price index for financial services provided by pension funds and the price index for financial service charges, fees, and commissions.  More encouraging to me is the fact that both the median CPI and the trimmed mean PCE show continued deceleration.  The fraction of components in the PCE registering price declines remains elevated and sustained.  According to our calculation, over the past 12 months the fraction of falling price components has averaged 40 percent compared with an average 32 percent from 1994 to September of 2008. Having said all of that, my outlook for economic growth has not changed.  I am not as pessimistic as the New York Fed appears to reporta number, by the way, which I note is strikingly close to what Goldman Sachs is forecasting.",

  "MR. FUHRER.": [
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about how to introduce this topic this morning I was tempted to extend the Titanic metaphor of yesterday afternoon. Were I to do that, I might note that First Officer Wilcox and Ensign Sheets had left the Committee in the middle of the frigid North Atlantic, clinging to flimsy \nlife boats, while the sharks of high unemployment and highly uncertain inflation circled hungrily. Fortunately, the intrepid crew of the R.M.S. Carpathia, headed by officers Michael Dotsey from Philadelphia, Mark Wynne from Dallas, and Jeff Fuhrer from Boston, were steaming their way to extricate the Committee from its rather precarious circumstances.  However, I chose not to extend that metaphor.",
    "Further, in part, because, unlike Batman, who seems to have an endless supply of tools in his utility belt to take care of any circumstances that might arise in Gotham City, we dont actually have any such tools to extricate you from your predicament.  So, I will move on and leave that belabored metaphor alone. \n         In weighing the options for monetary policy in the coming years, inflation plays a pivotal role. If inflation stabilizes at its recent level and then rises gradually to the Committees implicit goal, while unemployment declines towards a rate consistent with full employment over the same horizon, many will consider this an acceptable outcome.  If, on the other hand, inflation continues to decline in the presence of elevated unemployment, falling more significantly below the Committees goal, then the Committees policy decisions could become much more complicated. Which of these outcomes materializes will depend on what determines inflation in the short run. So what does determine inflation?  In answering this question, I am reminded of one of my favorite stories, which involves Sigmund Freud and one of his graduate students (and which is probably entirely apocryphal).  The student was troubled about Freuds theory that all dreams reflect wish fulfillment.  She had a recurrent dream in which she murdered her young children, and she found it impossible to believe that this dream reflected her wishes.  When she posed this dilemma to Freud, he thought for a moment and replied, But dont you see that your \ndream simply reflects your wish to disprove my theories?",
    "Ill get the middle name next time.",
    "The goal keeps increasing. At the micro level, lets think about the story that motivates these kinds of models that we use, which at its base is not unreasonable, and that is that there are firms who are trying to set prices. What do they consider in trying to set prices?  They think about their cost structure.  Thats where the marginal cost comes from.  I would say that today the cost structure really is challenged. Wages are pressured to be quite low, and productivity appears to be fairly high.  So from the cost side, that puts downward pressure.  The other thing that they take into account is how much they can mark up over those costs.  Thats a factor of market power and current demand circumstances.  And I would say, there again, the ability to mark up over their cost structure is not terrific. So you dont need the pointy-headed rational expectations model to tell you that the key determinants that fold into these models would suggest that, in current \ncircumstances, the pressures on inflation, taking into account expectations and costs and gaps or whatever else, appear to be on the downside.  Thats the way I would answer that question. Now, I did say, as President Plosser emphasized, that we need to have some humility when we approach this. And I think that to date we are starting to see perhaps the beginning of a puzzle that says, as Mike Dotsey suggested, that inflation maybe should have fallen more than these models have suggested.  And I think well be looking at that carefully, because if it doesnt fall noticeably over the next year, we have some splaining to do."

    "Good morning. Thank you. The Tenth District, like the rest of the nation, appears to be climbing its way out of the recession.  Weve seen some slight improvement in retail sales, our manufacturing index is up above 50, and theres clearly some improvement in our inventory situation, notably in housing, which has stabilizedin fact, were \nactually seeing some improvement.  Where we continue to struggle is, obviously, with commercial real estate, which is a big issue for us.  Our agricultural sector this year will be down, because prices are down, primarily for bumper crops.  Also, our labor markets are stable, theyre not improving. They may show some uptick, but very little, we suspect, as the economy and the region has settled out. Even our energy sector, which has been in the doldrumsas President Fisher said, because we produce a lot of natural gashas at least stabilized for now.  So were working our way out, and, I would say, in a manner similar to that for the nation as a whole. When we consider the nation and the outlook, I think that we are in recovery.  There are signs, in our region and elsewhere, of self-correcting mechanismsthe runoff in inventories, the \nrebuilding, manufacturing picking up.  Some of that is self-sustaining, hopefully, and will move us forward. As weve started this recovery, and as we look forward, there continues to be enormous stimulus that is yet to play out, both fiscal stimulus that is under way and will go through 2010 and monetary stimulus as well.  And I think thats very important to keep in mind as we look ahead. As we anticipate inflation and issues like that, I think its also important to remember that we do need to look many quarters ahead, because everything thats happening today reflects \nsteps we were involved in several quarters ago, or at least in the spring.  In that regard, I think we face a challenge looking at the immediate recovery, sustaining that recovery, and then looking far enough ahead that we dont introduce new problems for ourselves.  And thats what I do \nworry about regarding inflation and other asset issues that might come up. Were going to be in a position of trying, as you say, to bring our monetary policy to a more neutral level in those quarters.  Its going to take a long time to do that.  And well be using instruments weve never used beforethat means theres going to be slippage, and that means there are going to be mistakes.  Anticipating the next discussion a little bit, as we think about first quarter, when I think there is a good chance the recovery will be sustained, I cannot help but wonder if one of our most important toolsand there is risk with every choice we makeis to do nothing in terms of buying assets that we would then almost immediately have to sterilize. On the matter of excess capacity, of course, we are just starting the recovery, so there is excess capacity. For example, a while ago, if you took a railroad in my part of the world and you asked the CEO about capacity, hed have told you that he had cars parked that would just about cross the state of Kansasand for those of you who dont know Kansas, thats a long way.",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I find myself within the central tendency of Committee projections, maybe including the Philadelphia staff in that central tendency.",
    "But there is not much comfort in numbers, is there? I think I agree with everyone that data since the last meeting indicate that the steep decline in spending and production is ongoing. Employment and production have been cut back especially sharply as businesses are adjusting to the collapse in demand that we saw last fall by reducing inventories \nand head count very, very aggressively. Final demand is also continuing to contract.  Consumption, business equipment spending, and housing are all falling rapidly, and commercial construction is on the cusp of pulling back in a major way.  There is really no sign that the pace \nof decline in final demand is slowing. To some extent, the ongoing drop in final demand reflects the playing out of the downward shift in demand and the tightening of financial conditions that we saw last fall.  That is, we are seeing the kind of multiplieraccelerator effects that we saw before on consumption, working through declines in jobs and income, now on business capital spending, working through expectations of weaker sales going forward.  I think I saw an accelerator chart yesterday.  We are also feeling the lagged effects of tighter credit in the fourth quarter and sharp declines in equity and housing markets then.  Now, presumably these sorts of downward pressures on spending from past real and financial shocks would diminish over time, though it could be quite some time before they play out.  Unfortunately, I think that, on top of the playing out of those effects, there are some further new pressures on spending coming into play.  Further declines in prices of housing and \n equity in the first quarter will weigh on consumption going forward, and equity prices were lower than what the Greenbook had assumed.  The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey suggests that the tightening of credit by banks is continuing, and I am sure that the mounting layoffs are increasing the fear of job loss and continuing to depress, if not depressing even further, consumer confidence and sparking pullbacks in spending.  We have also heard many reports this morning about businesses becoming much more cautious.  Finally, as the Chairman and others have remarked, the remarkable widespread decline in economic activity abroad is just holding down demand all over.  It is reducing our exports. No part of the world economy is providing support to global demand. Despite some signs of improvement, financial markets remain severely disrupted and fragile.  Outside the GSEs, securitization markets remain virtually shut down.  Credit to any but high-quality borrowers is still very expensive.  For example, the yield on BBB corporate bonds, which would cover the median business, is about 2 percentage points higher than it was in the first half of September.  That is a pretty sharp increase in the cost of capital.  I have been especially worried, as others have remarked, about some of the developments in the last few weeks, some sort of backsliding in markets.  We have seen a further drop in equity prices and a strengthening of the dollar pointing to somewhat firmer financial conditions at a time when we need financial conditions to be easier. The further evidence of the vulnerability of banks and other intermediaries has been especially concerning.  Losses by these guys were much larger than people anticipated, even people with pessimistic views.  CDS spreads have risen in response to the sizable drop in stock prices.  LIBOR has backed up again a bit. We have said all along that part of the adjustment to the new steady state in financial markets will involve more credit flowing through intermediaries and less through securities \nmarkets.  But intermediaries remain under substantial pressure to deleverage, shrink assets, and conserve capital and liquidity, and there are lots of losses to come even under the moderate recession scenario of the Greenbook. The staff estimates that there are about $1 trillion of losses coming from the third quarter on, with about half of those at U.S. banks and thrifts.  So there is much more pain to come.  In this environment, both perceptions of risk and aversion to risk will remain heightened.  Banks will be capital-constrained and worried about their survival, and credit will be tight for some time, even with a well-designed TARP that has taxpayers taking tail risks from lenders through capital insurance and asset purchases. Still, I do have a rebound in the second half of the year. I do not know exactly what quarter it will occur in, but I do think there is a reasonable hope.  That is my modal forecast, and I think it is reasonable. There are a couple of reasons for that part of it.  It depends on government actions.  This massive fiscal stimulus is one obvious thing, but I also think a well-designed support package for banks that does reduce uncertainty and builds capital and further Federal Reserve actions that work to ease financial conditions will at least help to stabilize markets and stop the continued erosion of credit availability and perhaps begin to turn things around with slow improvement.  I think that at least we can stabilize things. There are some natural market mechanisms in play as well that will help to bring the economy back.  The drop in energy prices is certainly building real incomes, and the fall in house prices and lower interest rates are increasing affordability and, I think, will ultimately spur purchases. I think demand curves do slope downward and to the right eventuallyat least that is what I learned in Economics 101.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me hit some of these subjects as well.  Were in a position where doing the right thing is not obvious.  Were in a second-, third-, or fourth-best situation, and I think weve got to make the best of what were doing, given all of the constraints. It puts us in a very difficult situation. I would include the swaps in that. I would be in favor of going ahead because I think we need to have this in our arsenal.  But I do worry about the announcement effect and whether, as several people have pointed out, markets will figure out this is really about one institution otherwise, why are we doing this now?  We dont have the situation we had when we put the other swaps into play, in which there was generalized pressure on the markets.  So I guess the head of your transparency subcommittee is for being a little less transparent.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Im in favor of the action and language of alternative B with no primes.  I think we dont need to take additional action today.  We need to get further along in implementing what weve done.  With a less negative outlook, I think the need for an additional, immediate reaction is less pressing and, given the high level of uncertainty, it argues for being a little more gradual in our actions. Having said all that, I agree with many of the points that President Yellen made.  The outcomes we predicted are just not satisfactory from the perspective of the objectives that the Congress has given us. The lowest unemployment rate we have in 2011 is 6 percent.  Now, I think the NAIRU may have risen in the structural changes, but whether it has risen 2 full percentage points, I think even President Plosserlet the transcript show that President Plosser shook his head no.",
    "Everything we do is appropriate.",
    "And finally for Seth, are there any consequences of not covering our expenses?  Can we pay dividends?  Do we continue to pay salaries?",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I noted at the end of my remarks, I dont think the central tendency that weve submitted is really a satisfactory outcome for the economy.  Were looking at an unemployment ratejust considering the center of the central tendencyof about 8 percent in two and a half years and an inflation rate of 1 percent, which is below the 2 percent that most of us have favored; and thats probably headed lower unless the economy picks up steam very, very fast after that.  I think thats why most Taylor rules and the optimal control simulations that President Yellen mentioned call for negative nominal interest rates now. \n    Moreover, I think from a risk-management perspective, which we used to talk about around here, even though the risks are more balanced on either side of this sluggish recovery now than they were, I think the cost of a shortfall is greater than the cost of an overshoot.  We know how to counter inflation. Weve done it before and we can do it again.  But this central tendency tells me that, given the size of the shock, were having trouble getting satisfactory outcomes for output and inflation.  I think the risk, as President Bullard pointed out, is that we could be caught in a high-output-gap, low-inflation or even deflationary environment.  I dont think thats going to happen, but I think theres a risk there, and if we get caught in that, I think its very, very difficult to figure out how to get out of it.  This seemed to be much easier, Mr. Chairman, when we were lecturing Japan than when were doing it ourselves.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the language of alternative B.  I agree with President Plosser that the passage of time and the confirmation of the upturn in the economy brings exit closer, but the outcomes are still quite unsatisfactory through 2012, certainly by my forecast.  And looking at the central tendency of the Committees forecast, as Brian pointed out, in 2012 we still have resource utilization a couple of percentage points below where we think it should be over the longer run and inflation below where we think it should end up.  So being constrained at the lower bound, were not in any way at an optimal setting, and I think it will be quite a while before we tighten.  I had my tightening in mid-2011.  I think President Plosser and President Lacker have raised interesting points about how to structure the exit and what to do, and so we have all next year to discuss it."

    "I have a request, Mr. Chairman.  I asked the System Open Market Account manager a couple of days ago, but now he is not the manager anymore.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ill be very brief.  Our indicators and the anecdotal reports from the Fifth District are quite consistent with the national picture and the picture that emerges from the reports that we have heard around the table from the Reserve Bank Presidents so far today.  There are only three nuances that I would take note of.  One is recent declines in the wage indexes in the manufacturing and services areas in our Districtjust a couple of months of decline but potentially meaningful.  Second, on the other side, expected prices received in manufacturing have swung decisively from negative territory in November, more than minus 1 percent, to positive territory, above 1 percent.  Third, a fairly significant decline has occurred in the last two months in the index for expected capital spending in manufacturing. On the national level, our outlook is basically aligned with the Greenbook, with a couple of exceptions.  I am a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth when the recovery begins.  I expect inflation to return above 1 percent later this year and to get to about 1 percent rather than sag in the out years. I do not think we are going to want to keep the nominal rate at the floor for nearly as long as the Greenbook expects.  I am thinking liftoff is likely sometime in 2010 rather than in 2012. I endorse the statements made by Presidents Evans and Stern and others about the depressing effect of the lack of clarity around government credit policy.  Capital injections that have occurred so far and prospects for future capital injections seem to have induced a tipping dynamic by which we are at a corner solutionthere is no private equity coming in for fear of what future capital injections might do to them, and so we are left with the public sector being the only source of prospective capital. Looking ahead at the strategy, I think we want to get to a point where the banks are healthy, which means they can raise equity privately.  That transition \n is the hard one to solve, and I endorse the ideas that President Stern just alluded to.  I would also say that I think public statements about our potential future credit programs and the expansion of our programs to asset classes could well be a drawback in that they add uncertainty about where we are going to come in next.  I will cede the rest of my time to my past self.",
    "That would be an aggregator memo?",
    "Subject to the usual caveats.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  About asset purchases, I agree we should do more now. The monetary base has declined by $200 billion in the last couple of months.  That was unanticipated, at least on my part, and the outlook seems to have worsened.  So, if anything, we should be moving in the other direction. I have a concern Id like to discuss first about how we go about this.  We have these demand-driven credit programs that are having a big influence on the base.  Weve talked for two meetings now about different points of view about whether its credit programs and our asset side or whether its our liability side and the monetary base.  Weve talked about credit frictions, and weve talked about the demand for bank reserves.  I think if were honest with ourselves, we admit that we as a group dont have a clear viewwe havent decided between these two theories. Policy robustness suggests acting as if either could be true.  In this instance, the two dont conflict; they coincide. Both a focus on the base and a focus on the credit programs suggest we do more now because the economy has weakened in the last couple of months. What that perspective suggests to me is two things.  First, that in the materials we distribute before the meeting (this is something I have discussed with our secretary) its hard for me to evaluate alternatives that differ in the size of one program on our balance sheetthe  \n  SOMAwithout having a sense of whats happening to the rest of our balance sheet.  Theres a substantial amount of uncertainty about the TALF, about the CPFF rolling off, and so on.  It would make more sense, at least to me, for us to evaluate alternatives in terms of where the base is going to be. And this perspective of thinking that the base matters is one that leads me to think that maybe we should specify policy in terms of the base. The second implication that it suggests to me is that we might want to direct the Desk to ensure that the base does at least somethingthat it at least achieves a certain level or that it doesnt go down in the intermeeting period.  We could set an objective and say, By the next meeting the base goes up by at least X.  Such a line in the directive wouldnt conflict with any credit programs, but it would direct the Desk to offset any unanticipated falls in the base due to a running off of the credit programs.  This is something Id like to see us consider and talk about tomorrow. More broadly, I like President Bullards ideaand I think thats the way we ought to think about thisthat weve got to vary what we plan to do with the base in response to economic conditions, as in a sort of a reaction function.  I think were kind of groping toward this. What the New York staff did in forecasting the base is a great start, but its a little hard to get a handle on such a large aggregate number so far ahead.  Im not looking for daily or weekly forecasts of the basethat would be a little overkill.  But something with a bit more granularity on the time scale might be useful.  I recognize theres a lot of uncertainty about what these other contributors to fluctuations in the base are going to do in the near term, and we ought to take that into account. But I think setting a floor for the path for the base in the near term has some usefulness to it. \n   About mortgage-backed securities versus Treasuries, I have a preference for Treasuries.  The reason is twofold. I was asking Ms. Mosser about flexibility, and I thought that maybe intervening in Treasuries would be a little more flexible than in agencies.  But, more broadly, I worry about the exit problem, and I worry about the optics of a situation in which, when the recovery begins, were holding a huge portion of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, and were contemplating selling it off in order to tighten monetary policy. I worry about what elected political officials will have to say about that and what pressure they might bring to bear on us to forestall selling off a big agency portfolio.  I think wed face much less pressure with regard to Treasuries, appealing as we would to the 1951 accord. About FX swaps, I have very mixed feelings for live institutions.  Im very concerned that the presence of it, which the banks would obviously come to be aware of, would diminish their incentive to inoculate themselves against the circumstances that would give rise to their need for it, despite the best efforts of our supervisory staff to ensure they pursue those inoculations. I think Case 3 is persuasive in conjunction with the closedown or windup of a large institution. So Im willing to reluctantly support it.  I think we ought to be transparent about it, as President Rosengren said. About an accord, what youve outlined is not my ideal accord.  I dont think that the credit-risk-free line youve sketched is a bright one.  I think that the price that were paying is pretty high in terms of using the TALF to fund what in early February was announced as something that would be funded by the FDIC. Bank rescues, I think, are worthwhile; buying toxic assets is very worthwhile. I think its very important that it gets done.  Something clean and simple and uncomplicated has much to recommend it, so I find myself supporting President Rosengren on this, for some straightforward program. \n    At the last meeting, we talked a lot about the TALF.  I wont rehearse the things I said then about it, but Ill note now that to some extent what were doing is recreating leverage.  I thought that theres at least a case that a lot of what went wrong in the last decade was excessive leverage. And if you think too-big-to-fail is a problem, its a problem because it leads to excessive leverage. We seem to be trying to restore the status quo ex ante conditions in credit markets by restoring the same extent of leverage, and Im not sure that thats the right philosophy. Im not sure that we can have a lot of confidence about the incentives of the private participants in the partnership.  Are their incentives going to be to price it cleanly or to overpay because they have the downside put to us?  Im not sure I see analytically how that works out. Id like to get rid of the ring fences very soon.  I think New York has executed theirs. We in Richmond have not executed ours.  If theres any chance of relieving us of having to execute that legal document, Id really appreciate it.",
    "In the past, the Richmond Bank and I, myself, have had a tradition of voting against these. Earlier this year I did vote in favor of the swap lines that were introduced as part of our management of this crisis.  Im willing to support these, given that a reexamination of these is under way. The distinction in my mind is the association of these particular swap lines with the history of foreign exchange intervention, which has been thought of as fiscal policy and outside the bounds of this institution, quaint as that notion may seem these days.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A bit of a shift in our District information is discernible over the last month or two.  First, the quantitative information.  Our Fifth District manufacturing survey, which you will recall is released a few days later than the New York and Philadelphia indexes, but covers more manufacturing activity than both of those indexes combined",
    "I believe more than the Dallas District as well.  The survey has moved sharply back to neutral over the last two months from the exceptionally negative readings we were seeing earlier, and the shipments and orders components have increased from around minus 50 in February to around zero now.  Interestingly, the six-months-ahead expectation measures for shipments and orders are solidly in positive territory, but the index for capital \n expenditures remains negative, suggesting that excess capacity will be restraining business investment for a while.  So far we have not seen similar moves in our service sector survey.  Overall our surveys suggest a bottoming out in goods production but continued decline in services. Qualitative information from our directors and other contacts also suggests a shift in tone from uniformly dismal to mixed.  Some directors see signs of life for building lot transactions in some marketsNorth Carolina and central Maryland were mentioned.  There are scattered reports of an increase in residential real estate traffic, although contacts are not yet saying that this has translated into increased sales.  Even though this may just be the seasonal pickup youd normally expect, people seem to be treating a normal seasonal pickup in real estate traffic as positive news, given the experience of the past few years. The Fifth District hospitality sector seems to have been hurt by a fear of adverse publicity. One director whose firm stages trade shows says that fun appears to be the new F word.",
    "A contact who runs a resort on the South Carolina coast reports corporations canceling bookings for which they have already paid in full.  People apparently dont want to risk the bad publicity of showing up, which is puzzling because critics presumably object to the expenditure not the utility derived.",
    "In West Virginia, the coal industry is described as somewhat shell-shocked because of falling coal prices, although drilling rigs from western states have been moving east to take advantage of increased drilling activity in the Marcellus shale formation. At the national level, there have been some signals consistent with a business cycle trough sometime in the middle of the year, I think.  I put the tentative signs of stabilization in the housing sector chief among these since the return of some confidence on that front seems \n  important for restoring a broader willingness by households to resume discretionary spending.  Of course, we have been fooled by hints of housing market bottoms before.  So it is not hard for me to curb my enthusiasm.  Still, the recent consumer spending numbers also suggest that a broader household resilience may be emerging.  Consumers seem to have been cutting back in response to the general erosion in their confidence about future income and wealth; and the fact that consumer spending was relatively stable in the first quarter, despite ending on a down note, might reflect some households looking through the recession toward a return to sustained \ngrowth. Similarly, I think the weakness in business spending has been driven mainly by a dearth of foreseeable profit opportunities as opposed to being held back by credit constraints.  The tentative signs of stabilization on the durable goods front are welcome news, but I think it will take some evidence of a sustained improvement in consumer spending and, thus, revenue growth to bring business spending back to the table in a major way. Regarding inflation, the stability of long-term expectations has been notable and stands in contrast to the Greenbooks forecasted expectations that inflation will drift steadily downward over the next few years. Personally, my outlook for inflation expectations is centered near 2 percent.  I think the inherent difficulties in projecting inflation expectations are significant, but theres also at least as much of a chance that they will increase significantly during the recovery rather than decrease. I continue to worry about how we are going to know whether we are doing enough, too little, or too much and how we are going to know when to begin unwinding the \nexpansion of our balance sheet. It seems like a daunting problem for us.  My sense is that credit spreads are going to be too ambiguous to act on, and I am leery of taking too much comfort from Japans experience. So I believe we could use a better understanding of the effect of our large reserve balances on the banking system. \n   Finally, Mr. Chairman, down in North Carolina the bankers are distributing these lapel pins. Theyre little round green things and they say EGBAR. Now I am not going to be able to do justice to a North Carolina drawl, but it comes out something like this:  Everythings going to be all right.",
    "I got this one for free, and that means it is worth less than $20.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Im comfortable with continuing on the path that we laid out at the last meetingexpanding our balance sheet.  We did pretty well against \n objectives over the intermeeting period.  Asset purchases added $215 billion, and the net runoffs in other lending, the reduction in the Treasurys general account, and some other miscellaneous wiggles in our balance sheet meant that currency plus reserves increased by $146 billion, virtually all of that in reserves.  So Im happy with how we did over the last intermeeting period. This last discussion has been fascinating against the backdrop of our not having a clear sense of exactly why and how expanding our balance sheet affects the world.  I think about all the experience weve had with tracing the course of the fed funds rate through a recovery and out again, and I look at the graphs of our balance sheet and the timing of the recession, and Im thinking, Why should our balance sheet peak in December or whenever it does? Do we have an analytical sense that thats the right timing for the magnitude of the stimulus? Are there announcement effects?  Maybe it doesnt matter.  Maybe its just the time path cumulatively summed. But this habitat theory doesnt say that there are announcement effects; Im not sure you get any announcement effects in that.  And is it the assets or the liabilities? Is it the base? I think were really groping in the dark here.  I think we need to recognize that. Id like to see the Desk pay some attention to the base and accelerate its pace of purchases a little if the credit programs are running off faster than we seek.  Similarly, if the credit programs dont run off as fast as we think, maybe the Desk could lighten the pace and respond accordingly. I think its going to be really hard to think about adjusting this over the year. As I said yesterday, its not likely to happen next week, for sure, but what if banks demand for liquidity, protection against adverse market events, falls or rises? That could shift the effect of what were doing. It could shift us toward a much more stimulative effect or a much less stimulative effect pretty suddenly, and I think we need to be alert for that. \n   As for the statement, something B-ish would be good for me.",
    "May consider? Adjusting somewhat.",
    "Somewhat is great the way we usually use ityou know, somewhat higher, somewhat lower.  That is a long and honored tradition in central banking.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ill start with our instructions to the Desk on asset purchases. I agree with Governor Kohn, and I was going to express it the same wayfor clarity of instructions, fixing a price or fixing a quantity really cant be beat.  I agree with President Bullard that a reaction function would be preferable on some grounds, and if we were able to communicate a well-understood one, that would be great.  But in this instance I just dont think we have the time to communicate that in a way that does not add uncertainty about the exact way in which were likely to react to incoming data.  Moreover, I want to emphasize that I think we should give the Desk less discretion, and I do that without any lack of respect for the tremendous acumen and skill of the people on the Desk.  Its just that it places an impossible burden on them to operationalize our terms of art in the directive and to communicate that \n  coherently to markets in a way that doesnt add chatter that we dont need and that distracts us from what were doing. As for monetizing debt, were monetizing mortgage-backed securities just as much as were monetizing debt.  I think the dangerand this has been the danger this springis conveying that the amount we monetize might vary with the amount the government issues.  Thats something we have to stay away from, and its another reason not to go down the path of seeking to adopt a kind of a reaction function that tries to skin a bunch of cats. As to our exit strategy, I think were likely to be in this situation with zero interest rates for a while. But I have a hard time ruling out the possibility that, if the Greenbooks expectation comes true, towards the end of the year there will be another gigantic sigh of relief, much as we experienced after the bottom in Marchmaybe not euphoria, but a turn in expectations and sentiment that makes the world look different and makes us at least want to think about backing away from stimulus before the end of the year.  I have no idea how likely that is, but I think we need to pay attention to the amount of stimulus were providing and the effects were having.  I \nthink we need to pay attention to the banking system, in particular, and to monitor bank asset \nholdings and their liquid liabilities and that channel for policy.  Sure, we were intervening in order to reduce MBS rates and to reduce Treasury yields below what they otherwise would have been. Granting that, its not clear which of those two channels had the bigger effect.  But we need to be thinking about the timingwhat its going to look like when its going to be the right \ntime. I think that its too early to signal that were thinking about exiting, but its not too early to explain in the Monetary Policy Report that we are thinking about what it would be like.  Were not thinking about doing it yet, but were planning and thinking carefully about the \n  mechanics of it.  I think that raising the interest rate on reserves seems quite likely to succeed.  To my mind, the most logical and natural path forward on this issue of reserve management is to use this opportunity to back away from federal funds rate targeting.  Weve backed away from nonborrowed reserves targeting. If historically, by some fluke, we had been targeting RP rates over the last three decades, I dont think we would have known the difference, and yet RP rates never equaled the fed funds rate. So I dont think we have a real strong reason to tie ourselves to the federal funds rate as opposed to the RP rate. The interest rate on reserves in this regime is going to be the relevant marginal rate for banks.  So when the time comes, I think we just back away from the target, explain that, heres our policy rate, the interest on reserves, and let it go at that. As a resultand this is sort of relatedI think we should be really hesitant to engage in clever tinkering to try to get around problems with this, as good as we seem to have been at clever tinkering recently. So to my mind, reserve collateral accounts are just not worth the bother. In terms of changing the leverage ratio and exempting some institutions, I dont think we should tinker with supervision and regulation just to solve a monetary policy problem.  I find the guidance thing to be even murkier. Im against Fed bills.  I dont want us to have that ability.  I dont want to make us a target for those who would want us to finance stuff.  Weve gotten involved in housing finance, and I think one of our biggest political problems in the next couple of years is going to be backing away from housing finance, the way we had to back away from it in the 1970s.  That \ntransition out, I think, would be made more difficult if we have this off-balance-sheet thing.  I was stunned to learn in the staff memos that if this had full faith and credit, our books would be consolidated with the U.S. government.  To me, that has some optical characteristics that I think \n  are dangerous for us as an institution.  Wed be seen as on balance sheet and yet outside of appropriations. So I just dont think we should go down that road. Hybrid ARMsagain, sort of clever tinkering. For us to go to these little markets and kind of try to pick up some effect just opens us to rent-seeking.  Maybe weve gotten good at handling it, but it just doesnt seem worth it to me. As for the facilities, I would have terminated them all.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Manufacturing in the Fifth District appears to be running ahead of the nation, and I guess fairly confidently I can say running ahead of the Fourth Districts. Our survey index moved up again last month and has been in positive territory for three months in a row.  And the new orders component registered a particularly strong increase. Our service sector continues to contract, however, although somewhat less broadly than before. What improvement has taken place has been most notable in nonretail businesses.  Apart from the cash-for-clunkers frenzy at auto dealers, retail firms in our District still report very slow shopper traffic and depressed big ticket sales. Our directors and other contacts continue to describe conditions as gloomya view that seems to be associated with the low level of current activity rather than its rate of change.  I suspect they are less impressed than economists by trends in first differences.  Some of our contacts wonder how long current conditions will last, and one director reported that people are hanging on like Sergeant Snorkel, a character in the Beetle Bailey comic strip who is sometimes seen dangling from a small tree growing out of the side of a cliff.",
    "On the other hand, we have also heard reports of activity picking up here and there around the District.  Both our surveys and our other contacts indicate little or no price pressures at this point.  A couple of our bankers report strong deposit growth.  One cited state and local government shifting funds out of money market mutual funds in order to obtain unlimited federal insurance.  Some of our large banksand I have seen these reports from elsewhere in the countryhave seen a small decline in early-stage credit card delinquencies, thirty days or less, which they believe may be the beginning of a peak in consumer credit losses. \n  But one of our banks has done some really interesting research.  This is a large, formerly monoline credit card bank with a fairly good reputation for quantitative research.  Their staff looked at the 2001 and 2008 stimulus programs.  And there, because the disbursement was \nstaggered by the last two digits of your Social Security number, they were able to trace the effect through their customer base.  They estimate an effect between 20 and 50 basis points on their second-quarter early-stage delinquencies from the stimulus payments this year.  This is enough to undo the decline from the first to the second quarter in the early-stage delinquency results that they saw. Now, that said, if you look at their monthly data, even with the adjustment they still show a peak in May rather than in March as in the unadjusted data.  So there is still a glimmer of hope, but it is a fainter glimmer than one would take just from the raw numbers.  I thought that was pretty interesting. Since our last meeting, the national data have come in pretty much as expected or, in some cases, not quite as dismal as expected.  As a result, our projections havent changed appreciably.  It seems pretty clear now that the downturn has ended, and positive economic \ngrowth is set to resume.  But as I said, I get the sense that economists are taking more comfort in this than anyone else. And it seems as though many people are coping with the depressed level of current activity and uncertainty about the timing and strength of the recovery.  I think that, in turn, is going to depend critically on the path of household spending.  The 2 percent decline in real consumption from the end of 07 through the beginning of this year has been fairly extraordinary. But the fact that consumption has been fairly flat this year I take as encouraging, considering the decline in compensation and the tightening in credit terms over that period.  This \nsuggests that consumer spending is likely to expand if labor market conditions stabilize and the \nrecent gains in household net worth are sustained.  That expansion is likely to be at a cautious \n  pace, however.  Labor market conditions may stop deteriorating, but they are unlikely to improve dramatically anytime soon, I think.  And any recovery in consumer creditworthiness is likely to depend on improvements in consumer income prospects. For other components of demand, the outlook is more mixed, as some of you have said.  The prospects in nonresidential construction are bleak, given the ongoing rise in vacancy rates.  \nBut the inventory swing in GDP is going to give us a second-half boost, and the drag from \nresidential investment appears to be lessening as housing starts begin to affect the flow of residential construction spending. Inflation has been sort of choppy lately but reasonably well contained.  Core PCE over the last six months averaged 1.8 percent or a few tenths lower if you back out those tobacco tax hikes. One widespread view is that some sort of output gap is going to hold down inflation.  There has been a little commentary on this so far around this table.  This situation bears some resemblance to the beginning of the last recovery in late 2003, when the Greenbook forecast had inflation falling to 1 percent because of the remaining slack in the economy at that time.  Of course, we had that scare in early 2003, when core inflation seemed to fall below 1 percent for a time.  But by the time of the December meeting, inflation was running around 2 percent in the data we had at that meeting.  Moreover, TIPS inflation compensation had risen pretty sharply in the second half of 2003, so inflation expectations and our expectations about the output gap were giving conflicting signals about how inflation was going to evolve.  As it turned out, what we got was a small inflation scare in 2004, not disinflation.  Overall inflation turned out to be 3 percent in 04. Core inflation was 2 percent. And it suggests that, at least in that episode, expectations trumped the gap. \nReflecting on that episode reinforces my skepticismothers have commented on this about the usefulness of conventional output gaps for forecasting inflation, particularly at the beginning of a recovery.  Now you might argue that the amount of slack in the economy was far less then and it is far larger now.  The unemployment rate then was only about 6 percent.  And that may be true, but then the question that arises is, Why hasnt inflation fallen by more now if the output gap is so much larger?  And a recent San Francisco Fed publication by a couple of its economists made this point pretty firmly.   President Plosser and I discussed output gaps with Mr. Kiley at the June meeting.  That conversation may have seemed a bit confusing.  It was when I read the transcript.",

    "Potentially a primary strategy.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At this time, I dont think it is warranted to increase interest rates, so I am in favor of alternative B, with some comments on the language that I want to focus on. First, let me say with regard to the agency debt language, it is still $175 billion too high in my view. But it is a step in the right direction.  I would support that \nchange. I share President Plossers eagerness to move to the some time language, but right now I think it is probably too soon, with all due respect, to make that move.  So I am happy leaving the extended period language in there.  I strongly support adding the list of economic conditions to spell out, to some extent, the nature of our reaction function.  I think that is a good idea. I think that is way better than treating markets to an extended period of altered adjectives on our way to our first increase. My comments have to do with just wanting to tighten up how we all understand that and how we communicate that new language. So, as I said earlierand I did a very imprecise job of explaining thisthe way I view the little grammatical construction of the sentence is that our forecast is, if these three conditions are all true, then interest rates will be low.  Now, in my view, that doesnt say anything about the states of the world in the future in which one of those is false.  So I dont view it as, strictly speaking, tying our hands to move if one of those conditions is violated. So I think it is a minimal, nice, sort of judicious conveyance of the things we are going to be focusing on and that are important, what they can count on with regard to keeping interest rates low, and what might trigger but wouldnt necessarily trigger an increase.  So I dont think it ties our hands too much.  I know that is always a broad concern.  From that point of view, I am a little uncomfortable with the including language.  Maybe we wont keep secret these other conditions, which is not to put them in the statement, but its hard to think of another condition that we care about that wouldnt have an effect or be expected to have an effect on these three thingsinflation and rates of resource utilization, which I take to be a reference broadly to economic activity.  So the value of the dollar, for example, is going to have an effect on economic activity.  Fiscal policy potentially is something you might point to, but, there again, that would imply a change in economic activity absent our reaction.  So I dont view this as \n useful, and it waters down the conditionality because, remember, it would make the statement that there are more than three things that have to be true, and we are going to tell you three of them, under which interest rates will always be low.  But there are some others we are not going to tell you about. So I think it would be clear if we dropped the including and went back to the original thing. The main concern I have about the language is the phrase low rates of resource utilization. Now, let me make clear that, unlike President Plosser, I dont object to the use of the phrase resource utilization here because this is not in the context of an inflation forecast.  I think it is quite logical to benchmark our description of the level of economic activity in terms of some normative or long-run averages or sorts of norms, the way President Kocherlakota did.  So I am comfortable with it in this context.  My concern is that low is a very imprecise term and could be interpreted more broadly than I think we have in mind.  And to my mind, it has this whiff of association with policy under the sort of stopgo era of policy, when we waited until we got back to something like full employment or thought of ourselves as waiting until the unemployment rate was all the way back again to normal before we raised rates.  And I dont think we want to be that liberal.  I dont think we want to cast that wide a net around the conditions under which we are going to keep rates low.  So I would be more comfortable with a tighter characterization. Now, this also made me think of President Bullards memo, in which he argued that the range of uncertainty about the level of the output gap is an argument for working in terms of first differences rather than levels of gaps. And that would suggest some sort of first-difference language here. Unfortunately, the best I could come up with was non-increasing rates of resource utilization. That struck me as so clunky and so obscure as to not really be a serious \n  contender. As a substitute for that, some tighter characterization of low would be usefullike very low.",
    "The question is, What is the object of their endeavors in their cottages?",
    "Ill pass. Honest.",
    "I changed my mind.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am not sure I have ever seen President Dudley blush.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have some attraction for alternative C.  I dont think we need to provide further stimulus over the next couple of months by buying more MBS. If we had committed a couple of months ago to buying the amount listed in alternative C, I dont think we would decide to increase that amount to match up with alternative B. I think that President Kocherlakota was very eloquent about the concerns about our balance sheet, especially our strategy past March.  I think Mr. Sacks graphs showing the \noption-adjusted spread on MBS is stunning. It shows that we have driven MBS spreads well below historic norms.  And I think its worth keeping in mind that those historic norms already \nreflected an implicit subsidy due to the perceived status of the government sponsored enterprises as benefiting from a government guarantee.  President Kocherlakota pointed to the value of our asset purchases last fall and earlier this year in improving market function, and the natural metric \nfor that is spreads. These spreads have not only restored market functioning, if you take them as a serious indicator, but we have gone beyond that, and were subsidizing the housing market \nnow. I think we should look at our MBS strategy in terms of the composition of aggregate demand that we want to foster.  Do we want to tilt aggregate demand towards housing and away from other components?  I understand the need to stabilize the housing market, and we did that earlier this year. The market was in freefall.  Prices were falling.  That was cutting household net worth. People were cutting back on consumption.  They did not know where things were going. But the market is broadly stabilized now.  Prices have pretty much stabilized at the national level, though there is local price movement.  Granted, there is a huge foreclosure overhang, but the market is working through those foreclosures, working through those \nworkouts, transferring those assets to productive hands.  I dont see the need to drive MBS down further, and I dont think as a long-run matter we want to be skewing demand towards housing construction. Its an easy fix for a weak economy.  Its easy to get those construction teams out there putting foundations in and putting up frames, but if we havent built too much housing \nnow, I am not sure when in our history we ever have.  Having said all of that, I do believe I can bring myself to support alternative B on the grounds that we already have made a commitment to \n purchase the full allotment at the next two meetings, and perhaps not enough has changed since that decision two months ago. One thing I like very much about alternatives B and C is the new final paragraph announcing the winding down of our presence.  I think it will be interpreted as an all clear siren, a signal of our view that the financial market crisis is more or less over and the conditions are no longer unusual and exigent.  I think thats a good signal to send.  I think it will contribute to a little more confidence at the margin in the recovery. I believe we should let mortgage-backed securities roll off as they mature.  I think that the primary credit rate is worth thinking about and studying, but again, like President Fisher, I was caught unawares by that issue and would like to go back and put some numbers down on paper about potential slopes of the yield curve and in the primary credit rate and think about what it means for the term deposit facility and our overall configuration.  President Plosser mentioned this as well. The TALF sentenceId like to see it remain the way it is.  I still havent seen evidence that the CMBS market is remedially fixable. Quantities are low, but it sure looks like fundamentals are troubled there. Holdings I think would be a useful change.  I support President Kocherlakotas suggestion that we reword our reference to our assets in terms of holdings. I also support President Bullards suggestion to move paragraph 2 of alternative C into paragraph 2 of alternative B, although if we dont do that after todays discussion of inflation dynamics and output gaps, we might want to think about replacing the phrase substantial resource slack, with low marginal cost."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, since we are beginning the year, a broad appeal to speak to the furthest person in the room rather than to the person next to you.",
    "It is very hard to follow many of these answers because I cant hear you down at this \n   end of the table, and I can imagine our colleagues here in the back of the room have no idea what is being discussed. A couple of questions. It is probably a little premature to be thinking in this detail, but the institution that Nathan described I think we can all guess because of their foreign operations.  They have funding needs in many, many currencies.  Charlie, can you hear me at the end of the table?",
    "Can you answer the buggy whip question?",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start by congratulating you on having a highway interchange named after you.  Im sure we all envy you having your own off-ramp.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the case for increased asset purchases is pretty compelling.  Its the sense of the Committee, and certainly I agree with that.  So I have to think through a series of other decisions.  The first one has to do with scale, and my thinking coming in was that the scale needed to be proportionate to the deterioration in the outlook. Speaking at least for myself and the Atlanta analysis, clearly, there has been deterioration since January, but its within the range that I would have assumed at that time was plausible.  So Im a little concerned about overreacting.  When we first got the alternatives, alternative B was $500 billion, and that, of course, was entirely in mortgage-backed securities and agency notes. Yesterday we learned that the TALF is likely to roll out slowly.  Thats information that, I assume, is not going to be understood by the public.  It would probably undermine the program if we said that we expected that.  I had factored the TALF into my sense of proportional response. So I favor the alternatives that are below $1 trillion dollars.  I dont want to overstate this, but I think we dont have good guideposts for how to size the action, so I think its reasonable to ask: Will the public infer from our actions that we know something that they dont, and is this response of over $1 trillionwhich will probably get some headlines really a signal that things are even worse than they actually are and in that sense could dig us a little bit deeper? Regarding timing:  if we go with the mortgage-backed securities alternative, I do favor the views of President Rosengren that theres a chance of accelerating that and making it have high impact in the near term.  I can support the Treasury idea.  But I actually think the central \n   question is the choice between Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.  I can support Treasuries, but my bias really is to favor the mortgage-backed securities option, so that would be one of the option Bs. I like that for its certainty, its impact on housing, and its clarity in communications. As I mentioned yesterday in my comments about communications, certainly what Im hearing is that many of our constituencies would prefer simplicity and not a lot of new programs, so Im leaning against the Treasury purchases because it adds complicating factors.  But if we are going to support the Treasury purchases, I endorse Governor Tarullos suggestion that we explain why we did it very clearly. For example, if we are doing it for liquidity reasons, then we should explain that; if were doing it for the purpose of scaling up the balance sheet, we should explain that; if we believe that there are spillover effects, we should be explicit about that in our rationale. Regarding statement content, I have some sympathy for the version offered by Presidents Plosser and Bullard, but Im not sure we can avoid quantities.  I think the logical question that the press is going to ask, having been conditioned to hearing quantities, is:  How much does this add up to?  Its very hard for us not to provide at least some estimate of that.  Conceivably there is some way of crafting language that would address both the pace of purchases as well as the ultimate quantity.  I dont know how specific we have to be in the directive to make it a workable directive. So Id leave that up to the Desk.  Im also okay with toning down severe contractionthat was my original reaction when I read the alternatives a few days agoto something thats not quite as stark as that.  Regarding statement structure, I dont have a strong feeling. I think we have two options.  You either have a structure that builds up to the action, which has been our traditional approach, or the action followed by the rationale.  I have a slight preference for building up to the action, based on Governor Kohns comment, namely, what \n   happens if we dont, in fact, have an action.  We certainly want to be consistent going forward, as much as we can, on how these things are put together.  So given all of that, where I come out is in support of alternative B, but, when it comes down to the vote, I will support A, A, or A plus or B",
    "Mr. Chairman, I agree with the staff assessment thatto use their wordshints of stabilization in the incoming data and some favorable financial developments since the time of the March meeting have occurred.  But I also agree with their words that the evidence on this issue is by no means decisive.  I see the situation as quite ambiguous. I note a positive turn in business sentiment in my District.

The economic story in my view is unfolding close to my expectations, and negative deviations from this outlook might justify an increment of stimulus as detailed in alternative A, but I dont see such deviations developing quite yet.  At the same time, as noted in the earlier go-round, I view the economy as remaining in a fragile condition, so I think the reduction in stimulus laid out in alternative C is premature.  I support the language in alternative B (revised).  I think it best serves us in remaining flexible and keeping our options open. And I dont favor the language prepared to consider in alternative B. In our deliberations, we translated this subtly suggestive language into Southern.  In Southern it would come out fixin to ponder.",

    "Great list of questions.  With regard to the workings of the fed funds market, I think that, as I mentioned, there is about $125 billion traded per day in the fed funds market.  About half of that is bank to bank, and I dont think we know how disruptive that would be if there were reverse RPs or whether that would continue. I have looked at the distribution of banks balances after you remove the fed funds trades they do per day, and there are still many banks that operate with negative balances per day and, therefore, have to enter the fed funds market. This is obviously a choice that they are making today.  Even with an expanded balance sheet of $1 trillion, lets say, the payments that cross our systems each day amount to about $3 trillion to $4 trillion. So there will still be a need for banks to trade fed funds.  I dont think that that market would necessarily either disappear or be severely adversely affected. Would these be redundant if we used reverse RPs with the GSEs? I think largely they would be redundant, if we use reverse RPs with the GSEs.  However, these would be available to banks as well as to other entities. So as Chris explained, if we just remove the balances from the GSEs, there is still a question of where the funds rate would settle.  I believe that the RCAs, by virtue of their applicability to any participant in the market, would set a harder floor on the fed \n funds market.  I think the question is whether we think RPs are more operationally complex, more hands-on intervening in the market, versus the RCAs, which might be thought of as allowing the market participants to trade among themselves and find the rate. Then, the question is, Would the market bifurcate into two pieces?  That is a clear possibility. We would have the collateralized market, which would be the floor rate essentially, and the uncollateralized market, which would continue as it is today.  So it would add a new part to the market.  Whether or not that would be seen to be desirable I dont know.  If I may say, as the Chairman was saying that we have a belt-and-suspenders approach, the RCAs are an idea to tighten the belt."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like everybodys District, our District has slowed and continues to look very weak.  The business outlook survey actually rose a little last \n   month, but it is still measured deeply in recessionary territory.  Our banks continue to lendto households, in particular. They have cut back on commercial lending, and credit quality continues to deteriorate across all loan categories in the District.  Housing sales are down, but prices have not fallen to the degree that they have in some parts of the country, probably on averagethe declines have been more modest.  And the housing problems are not quite as bad as in some parts of the nation, but everything has deteriorated.  So, basically, in the Third District, the current economy and its outlook look largely like those of the nation as a whole, and all indications are that this recession will certainly be one of the worst in the postwar period. There are lots of reasons for doom and gloom.  As we have just heard, there are lots of reasons that we think that this recession and this weakness will continue, perhaps for some time to come.  But somebody has to take a somewhat more optimistic viewjust to make the \ndistribution complete, if for no other reason, right?",
    "I think there are common \nelements to many business cycles.  I also find that one thing people have focused on a lot regarding the press and other things is that business sentiment, consumer confidence, and how people feel about the future appear to be very sensitive in this particular phase of the cycle.  Those things are pretty gloomy right now, but I would suggest that many economic cycles do have some commonalities, and one of those commonalities that often appearnot every time, but oftenis that sentiment can turn around very quickly and it can change for reasons that sometimes we dont understand or cant easily predict. It is also true that financial markets can move very quickly in various directions.  We have seen them move very quickly to the bad.  Once markets begin to heal, they could move very quickly in the other direction. So for the sake of optimism, I think there is still a possibility that at some pointmaybe not in the first half of this year and maybe not even in the second, but \n    there is still the hopethings could turn fairly quickly.  I am not basing a lot on that, but I do feel somewhat more optimistic than a lot of peopleincluding my staff, by the way.  They forced me to say that they take no responsibility for this,",
    "Weve done a lot of things without much history.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee has embarked on a strategy of working on all fronts to combat the severe economic downturn and continuing problems in \nour financial intermediation sector.  The recent return of some relative stability in financial \n  markets is, of course, welcome.  But I believe it remains fragile.  In particular, as many noted yesterday, I think that the pending release of the banks supervisory stress tests has the potential to be very disruptive to markets. Lets hope that doesnt happen. Like many of you, I agree that the type of recovery we are likely to see is going to be modest, but my reasoning and my view of that modest recovery is somewhat different from those \nperhaps expressed through the Greenbook. As I tried to articulate yesterday, my view of the \ndecline in equilibrium output is driven by a severe shock to the financial intermediation sector.  \nIt might be not only large but also fairly persistent.  Wthan-normal unemployment ratessectoral reallocations as the Chairman is referring toand \nperhaps imbalances that the economy must work through in response to that shock.  Thus, GDP will be lower and unemployment rates will be higher.  The main difference such a view has for \nthe outlook, compared with the Greenbook view, is the models implications for output gaps, inflation, and policy paths.  In this equilibrium story, the real allocations must occur, but it is dubious that the policy actions can do much to prevent those costs from occurring.  This view also implies that gaps are smaller and less downward pressure on inflation is present, and thus the appropriate policy paths under consideration would be less expansive in order to constrain inflation. Turning to policy, I think we face some very big challenges and uncertainties.  The Board has now approved another expansion in eligible collateral for the TALF, with the previous expansion announced just a month ago.  And the staff is considering even further collateral expansions, including legacy assets, with recommendations expected in the next few weeks.  It seems as though we are in a cycle in which we announce interventions in one market or asset \n type and then almost immediately turn around and consider other interventions in other markets and other asset types. Clearly, our intention is to improve market functioning in these sectors.  But I am increasingly uncomfortable with the practice, and I am concerned that our announcementsand indeed the whole strategy of gradually expanding the breadth and scope of our interventions across both asset classes and maturitiesare another source of instability in the marketplace.  I am not certain that we have adequately evaluated the interactions among all of these programs or that we have an adequate sense of the marginal benefit of the incremental actions that we are undertaking. Moreover, can we be sure that our programs are not distorting markets, discouraging the return of participants who are waiting on the sidelines for the next great deal or subsidy from the Federal Reserve policies, and hampering the development of new, sustainable market mechanisms for raising capital and allocating credit, thus actually delaying financial market recovery? As I have said before, I am not against expanding our balance sheet, given the current economic conditions and outlook.  I do prefer that expansion be done with more-liquid government securities, such as Treasuries rather than MBS, relative to illiquid private securities.  I am troubled by our difficulty in quantitatively determining what might be the right amount of expansion that is appropriate.  Nevertheless, given our current commitments, I am against announcing any further increases today. The change in the forecast, and certainly in the Greenbook and many peoples forecasts since March, doesnt seem to warrant further expansions. I think we need to give our actions time to work. Thus I favor some version of B, B, B, or B.",
    "I kind of like it.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Good morning.  Business conditions in the Third District remained relatively soft in May and early June.  Nevertheless, the steepness of the decline appears to have eased rather dramatically, and the tone from our business contacts has noticeably improved. While our contacts dont expect a strong upturn in business activity, they clearly see signs of stabilization in the near term. The most positive indicator from our Business Outlook Survey, which was released last week, is manufacturing, and that index said that general activity improved from a minus 22.6 in May to a minus 2.2 percent in Junea 20-point swing, which is rather significant as these standards go. This indicates essentially flat activity in the District now.  This is considerably stronger than some of the national industrial production numbers, but consistent with some of the other regional manufacturing surveys.  Our survey has a fairly long historya little longer than Richmonds, I believe, but Im not sure.",
    "Well, how much of the improvement of your forecast, in some sense, is reflected in the diminishing of the negative add-factors that you had been putting in before and how much of it is really the model?  I think you probably gave me as close to an answer on that as Im going to get.",

    "All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While the timing of our exit from this period of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation remains highly uncertain, I do think it is important for the Committee to begin to consider language that begins to prepare the markets \nfor that eventuality. Never being shy about being a maverick, I think that we should begin that process sooner rather than later. Thus, I have a general preference for the language in alternative C, although even in C I would not choose at this point to cut MBS purchases from $1.25 trillion to $1.1 trillion. Just at our last meeting we took out up to and, therefore, committed to $1.25 trillion. I dont think cutting it would be a good idea.  It would confuse the market at this point. However, for some strange reason, I get the impression that the Committee is not yet ready to adopt alternative C.",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. The Greenbook forecasts disinflation and high unemployment rates over the next two years. I agree with this forecast. These outcomes occur with an assumption that the federal funds rate will remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time, so I am very comfortable continuing to say that in the statement. \nIn terms of the LSAP program, we should purchase the entire $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. We should also taper the program, though I would prefer to leave the completion date flexible depending on market conditions.  I have a strong preference not to end the program prematurely.

    "1 Thank you. I should start with a warning that Im going to talk for a pretty long time.  I apologize in advance.  Prices of risky assets have continued to recover at an impressive pace, boosted by a more optimistic assessment of economic prospects and by favorable news on corporate earnings.  The advance in equity prices, shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, was particularly sharp, with broad indexes up 12 percent to 15 percent since the last FOMC meeting.  Equity prices were supported by sizable second-quarter earnings surprises that spanned a range of sectors. As shown in the top right, over three-quarters of S&P 500 companies posted \n        positive earnings surprises in the quarterabout the highest percentage observed over the past fifteen years.  At the same time, investors continued to become more optimistic about economic prospects.  The responses to our dealer survey indicated that market participants raised their forecasts for second-half growth and saw fewer downside risks to those forecasts. Given the news on earnings and the economy, investors perceptions of risk declined further, as indicated by the drop in the implied volatility of equity prices, the middle left panel.  Corresponding with that shift, investors showed a greater willingness to hold risky assets.  Retail investors, for example, have been reallocating large amounts of capital out of the safest asset classes, such as money market mutual funds, as shown in the middle right panel.  That capital appears to be making its way into a range of riskier asset classes, including equity and fixed-income funds both here and abroad. Given this shift in risk appetite, corporate bond spreads continued to narrow sharply, as shown in the bottom left panel, with the spread on the investment-grade index declining about 75 basis points and that on the high-yield index declining \nnearly 250 basis points since the last meeting.  Other risky asset classes, such as emerging-market debt and stocks, have also benefited. The panel to the right suggests that the dollar has also been strongly influenced by shifts in investor risk appetite. In particular, there has been a tight relationship between the dollar and risky asset prices, here captured by an emerging-market equity index, with the dollar appreciating last fall as investors attempted to move into safe \nassets and depreciating more recently as risk appetite returned.  On net, the dollar has fallen 1 percent to 2 percent on a broad, trade-weighted basis over the intermeeting period. The increased optimism about the economic outlook has coincided with favorable developments in the financial sector.  Share prices of large financial institutions rose substantially, as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2, in response to robust earnings reports. Those earnings were fueled by strong profits in trading and investment banking activity.  The durability of those sources of revenue is \nquestionable, but that did not seem to trouble investors. Earnings results for smaller and regional financial institutions were not as strong.  Those institutions benefited little from the robust trading gains that helped large firms.  Moreover, some regional banks posted greater-than-expected loan loss provisions for consumer loans, and many of them have considerable exposure to commercial real estate and construction loans.  Despite those hurdles, regional banks managed to meet their earnings expectations on average, and their share prices performed as well as those of larger firms over the intermeeting period. The difficulties at CIT that surfaced in mid-July highlighted the fact that financial institutions can still run into difficulties.  Nevertheless, financial markets continued to \n       function well throughout that episode. Moreover, investors perceptions of counterparty risk in the financial sector improved notably over the intermeeting period. CDS spreads for major financial institutions moved lower, by 50 to 200 basis points in most cases, as shown in the top right.  Moreover, the spread of LIBOR over the OIS rate, the middle left, continued to shrink, with the three-month spread falling below 30 basis points. At those maturities shown, spreads have reached levels that many thought would constitute the post-crisis normal.  Longer-term spreads, however, still remain elevated. One hurdle that the financial sector faces going forward is the expiration of the FDICs temporary liquidity guarantee program (or TLGP) on October 31.  The TLGP has allowed financial institutions to issue debt at a much lower cost than they would have otherwise paid, as indicated in the middle right panel.  Financial firms currently have $330 billion of outstanding debt under the program, with maturities out to three \nyears. As that debt matures and has to be rolled over into new securities, these firms will likely face higher financing costs.  However, given that the maturity of that debt \nis spread out and that firms have been making efforts to reduce their reliance on the program, market participants do not currently anticipate any problems around its \ntermination. This argument raises a broader point to be considered.  While money markets and financial markets more broadly have healed to a great degree, the improvement has been conditioned on a number of government support programsmany of which are scheduled to expire over the next six months.  Over the period between now and February 1, in chronological order, the markets will need to digest the end of the Treasurys money market guarantee program, the FDICs TLGP, the Feds large-scale asset-purchase (LSAP) program in Treasuries, the Feds MMIFF, the Treasurys purchases of agency MBS, the Feds LSAP programs in agency debt and MBS, the Treasurys credit facility for the GSEs (or GSECF), the Feds CPFF, AMLF, PDCF, and TSLF, and potentially the Treasurys TARP authority.  The good news is that we \nwill all benefit from some much-needed acronym relief;",
    "No.",
    "1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Prices on a broad range of risky assets continued to rise over the intermeeting period, fueled by an improving economic outlook and the low level of financing rates arising from the current stance of monetary policy. Broad equity indexes, shown in the upper left panel, rose more than 7 percent on balance, adding to the sizable recovery since the end of the first quarter.  Corporate bond spreads, the upper right, edged down further, leaving them dramatically improved from their levels earlier in the year. The gains over the past six months owe primarily to a more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook and a perception that the downside risks to growth have diminished.  Indeed, as captured in our primary dealer survey in the middle left panel, the upward revision in the expected path of GDP growth from earlier in the year has been substantial. In addition, respondents also indicated that the downside risks around the expected growth path diminished notably over this period.  This shift has reduced the amount of uncertainty that investors see in risky asset prices, as indicated by the relatively low levels of implied volatility on equities, shown to the right. The gains in asset prices have been so dramatic that market observers have begun to wonder whether the markets have become too frothy, with some pointing to the \nextensive liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve as a contributing factor.  By many metrics, however, asset valuations do not look too extended.  The Board staffs \nmeasure of the equity premium, shown in the bottom left panel, is still high by historical standards. Likewise, by many measures, corporate yield spreads still look relatively high, taking into account the outlook for defaults.  As shown in the bottom  right, expected corporate defaults have fallen substantially since earlier in the year, which likely explains a considerable portion of the narrowing of corporate yield spreads. Overall, risky asset prices have come a long way over the past six months, but so has the economic environment that they reflect. In contrast to the more accommodative conditions in financial markets, banks continued to restrict credit to private borrowers.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the volume of private loans at commercial banks (the dark blue line) has declined sharply. This decline has not been driven by a lack of available funds, as deposits (the orange line) have risen sharply and other sources of funding have become more readily available.  In fact, banks have been accumulating Treasury and agency securities (the light blue line) over this period. However, they have less appetite for adding credit risk to their portfolios, as they continue to repair their balance sheets and face additional loan write-downs going forward. Part of the decline in bank credit also reflects weaker demand.  The business sector as a whole has little need to raise new funds, and net borrowing by the sector has been negative in recent months.  In addition, firms with access to the market have shifted towards corporate bonds as a source of financing.  This shift can be seen in the \n        amount of high-yield debt that has been issued since the first quarter, the upper right panel. The pattern for consumer credit is similar in some regards.  Overall, consumer credit is contracting sharply, despite the issuance of a decent volume of consumer-related ABS. As shown in the middle left panel, ABS issuance reached $38 billion in the third quarter, near its pace from the previous quarter. Activity in the ABS market has been supported to a great extent by the TALF, with nearly all of the ABS deals in the third quarter brought to the market through the TALF. However, there are signs that dependence on the TALF is beginning to wane.  Most notably, even though most issuance is TALF-eligible, the amount of that issuance that is actually financed through the facility has been declining, a sign that private credit markets have improved enough to make TALF financing relatively expensive for some borrowers.  At the September subscription, for example, only \n$6 billion of the nearly $17 billion of ABS issued ended up being financed through the TALF. The better financing conditions and the greater willingness of investors to take risk have led to a further decline in ABS spreads, shown in the middle right panel.  Spreads for AAA-rated consumer ABS have returned to levels not seen since the middle of last year. Spreads also narrowed on outstanding CMBS, the bottom left, despite the ongoing worsening in the outlook for the commercial real estate sector.  The improvement in CMBS has been very much tied to government support programs, as the PPIP and the \nTALF have led market participants to anticipate greater demand for these assets.  The nine PPIP funds are in the process of raising capital and should begin purchases of assets later this year, and the TALF has now included three subscriptions covering legacy CMBS assets, financing over $4 billion of purchases.  In addition, a recently announced change by Treasury to the tax treatment of CMBS workouts seemed to provide a further boost to their prices.  Unfortunately, as shown to the right, issuance of new CMBS remains completely shut down, and the TALF has yet to fund any \nnew-issue CMBS.  Thus, the commercial real estate sector faces a very difficult credit \nenvironment going forward. Despite the broad increase in risky asset prices, Treasury yields moved lower over the intermeeting period.  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 3, Treasury coupon yields declined 15 to 30 basis points, on net.  The most important sources of the decline in longer-term rates, according to our dealer survey, were a decline in inflation expectations, a reduction in upside inflation risks, and strong demand from foreign official institutions. Consistent with those responses, forward break-even inflation rates, shown to the right, moved down over the intermeeting period.  \nInvestors also see less interest rate risk, as suggested by the implied volatility measures shown in the middle left panel, which have fallen notably from their elevated levels over the summer.  The perceived reduction in upside inflation risk and the decline in interest rate volatility may have contributed to a narrowing of the term premium embedded in longer-term yields.   \n          Investors also apparently marked down the expected path of monetary policy, as the substantial slack in the economy and other favorable inflation news supported the view that the Fed would remain on hold for an extended period.  As shown in the middle right panel, futures prices now suggest a later start to policy tightening.  That brings the market pricing closer to the results from our dealer survey.  As shown in the bottom left, most survey respondents do not expect the tightening to begin until the third quarter of 2010 or later. The FOMCs decision to taper its purchases of Treasury securities, announced at the last FOMC meeting, was well received by market participants.  This approach is widely seen by investors as a prudent exit strategy, and the announcement did not prompt any response in Treasury yields.  At present, the Desk has completed $289 billion of purchases, and it plans to wind down its remaining purchases over the \nnext five weeks, as shown in the bottom right panel, while still reaching a cumulative purchase total of $300 billion. The exit from the agency debt and MBS purchase programs could prove more challenging, however. As shown in the upper left panel of the next exhibit, option-adjusted MBS spreads over Treasury yields remain unusually tight.  In our view, Federal Reserve purchases have had a substantial effect on MBS rates, partly accounting for this low level of spreads. Market participants seem to agree with that assessment.  As shown to the right, the responses to our dealer survey indicate that the purchase programs are seen as pushing down the current-coupon MBS rate by a \nsignificant amount, with an average response of about 60 basis points.  However, it is worth noting that only a subset of respondents chose to provide such estimates, and the responses vary over a wide range. Given these effects, some observers are concerned that the MBS rate will rise sharply as the Feds purchases come to an end.  The extent of these concerns should \ndepend on ones views about how the purchase programs affect the markets.  As we \nhave highlighted in recent memos, the effect on market interest rates could come primarily through the stock of assets purchased, consistent with a portfolio balance \neffect. Under that perspective, even an abrupt end of the purchase program would not create market difficulties, as the stock of assets held outside the Fed would not change discretely. However, we have also highlighted the possibility that the flow of purchases could have some effect on rates due to various market imperfections.  In that case, one might be concerned about how the market would adjust to a sharp drop-off in asset purchases by the Fed. To gauge the scope of these different effects, we asked the respondents to our dealer survey about their views on how the Feds asset purchases affect the market.  The answers did not exactly settle the issue:  In rough terms, about one-third of the respondents said that the effects arise primarily through stock effects, one-third said primarily through flow effects, and one-third said through both.",
    "1 Thank you. The surge in the prices of risky assets that has taken place since March cooled off over the intermeeting period, as investors took note of the economic risks that remain and the ongoing difficulties facing the financial sector.  As shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, broad equity indexes declined modestly, on net, since the last FOMC meeting.  That is a notable downshift from the gains posted over the previous four intermeeting periods, which averaged over 8 percent per period. The drop in equity prices occurred despite favorable earnings surprises for the third quarter. As shown in the top right panel, more than 80 percent of the firms in the S&P 500 index beat expectationsan unusually high portion by historical standards. However, investors also focused on the growth of revenue, which was generally less impressive, and questioned the sustainability of profit growth.  Moreover, equity prices no longer benefited from the substantial upward revisions to the economic outlook that had propelled earlier gains.  Indeed, recent economic data have been seen as mixed, and the GDP forecasts of most market participants were essentially unchanged from the previous FOMC meeting, as indicated in the dealer survey responses in the middle left panel. One factor weighing on stocks was a growing concern among investors about prospects for financial firms.  Banks earnings reports continued to highlight many of the problems facing that sector, and investors also became increasingly concerned about how pending regulatory changes would affect those institutions.  As a result, \nfinancial shares lost ground over the intermeeting period, as shown in the middle right panel. Nonfinancial firms continued to be seen as relatively healthy.  Indeed, yield spreads on corporate bonds narrowed further over the intermeeting period, although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year, as shown in the bottom left panel.  Overall, despite their sharp gains from earlier in the year, we do not see equity or corporate bond prices as stretched well beyond fundamental values.  This can be seen in the Boards equity premium measure, shown to the right, which is wide by historical standards. It is also reflected in recent work by the New York Fed staff on high-yield bonds, suggesting that those yield spreads are near the levels expected given the outlook for defaults. Our assessment is that, overall, the levels of U.S. asset prices appear reasonable.   Nevertheless, this assessment could change if the very rapid gains from earlier in the year were to continue.  In this regard, the flattening out of asset prices since the last meeting could be regarded as a favorable development, as it suggests that those prices are still connected to fundamentals. As shown in the next exhibit, Treasury yields were little changed, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting.  In part, this pattern reflects that the incoming economic news has been mixed and has not provided any clear direction for yields.  Investors also took note of the considerable volume of commentary by Fed officials.  \nAs shown in the top right panel, FOMC members gave no less than 30 speeches in the month of October.  Im all for Central Bank transparency, but this may be going a bit \n   far.",
    "1  Since the last FOMC meeting, financial conditions have generally become more supportive of economic growth. Yields have declined at short- and intermediate-term maturities, and equity prices have posted a solid gain, while the dollar has remained about unchanged on net.  Some of the adjustment in financial markets appears to have been driven by increased confidence among investors that short-term interest rates will remain low.  The repetition of the extended period language in the November FOMC statement, along with the additional clarity provided by including explicit conditioning factors, seemed to solidify investors expectations that policy would remain on hold.  Subsequent speeches by FOMC members, including comments that U.S. asset prices do not look obviously out of line with fundamentals, were seen as providing further support to that view. In response, the expected path of monetary policy derived from futures quotes shifted down as much as 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, as shown in the upper left panel. \n       The Bluebook noted that these futures rates overstate what investors see as the most likely path for short-term interest rates, because they are influenced by the distribution of risks around that outcome.  This point can be made by looking at options prices to derive the perceived probabilities of different outcomes for the short-term interest rate, as shown in the distribution to the right.  According to that exercise, the most likely outcome for the three-month LIBOR rate about ten months \nfrom now is that it will remain in the 25 to 50 basis point range.  However, given the proximity of that outcome to the zero bound, the risk is skewed almost completely in \nthe direction of higher rates, pulling the mean of the distribution well above the mode.  As a result, the futures price, which corresponds to the mean, is about 50 basis points above what is seen as the most likely outcome. With this consideration, there does not appear to be much discrepancy left between market-based measures of policy expectations and survey responses, if the latter captures the modal outcome seen by respondents.  Our primary dealer survey indicates that the median respondent expects the first tightening to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010, with a range of views that spanned from the second quarter of 2010 to early 2012. We also used the survey to query dealers about their interpretation of the extended period language used in the FOMC statement.  By far, the most common response was that the extended period language would be removed three meetings before an actual rate hike. We are happy to use future versions of the survey to quantify any timing of policy tightening that you wantsuch as some time, a while, before long, or, maybe to accommodate some Committee members, immediately."

  "MR. SHEETS.": [
    "Thank you. Given ongoing stresses in the global financial system and the vulnerability of some key U.S. institutions to foreign-currency funding pressures, the staff has begun to assess the pros and cons of establishing temporary liquidity swap lines that would allow the Federal Reserve to lend euro, yen, sterling, and Swiss francs to U.S. institutions. These lines would be the mirror image of our existing swap lines and would allow the Federal Reserve to respond to eventualities ranging from a foreign-currency liquidity squeeze faced by a single U.S. bank all the way to a systemic shortage of foreign-currency funding among U.S. institutions.  We \nraise this issue in todays meeting in the spirit of bringing to your attention an issue that we see emerging on the horizon.  That said, we are still sorting through and evaluating a number of considerations that bear on this initiative, and we would very much appreciate your thoughts and guidance. One major money center bank has recently shown particular vulnerability to foreign-currency funding pressure. This institutions huge presence in foreign markets is reliant on secured and unsecured foreign-currency funding.  The vulnerability of its foreign deposit base and limited foreign-currency collateral has been apparent on a number of occasions over the past several months.  Indeed, just last Monday, when U.S. markets were closed, our bank supervisors had significant concerns regarding the institutions ability to access sufficient foreign-currency funding. There were similar worries during a particularly stressful period in November.  In each instance, the necessary financing was obtained, but the situation nevertheless remains fragile.  While this one institution is a focus of concern at present, we cannot rule out scenarios in which other large U.S. institutions also run into trouble meeting their foreign-currency funding needs.  There is a related risk that, once one U.S. institution showed pronounced vulnerability in this regard, other U.S. institutions might also then be viewed as vulnerable and that a broader foreign-currency liquidity crunch could develop. \n   These observations suggest that it would be prudent for the Federal Reserve to have the capacity to backstop the foreign-currency funding needs of U.S. institutions.  Establishing temporary swap lines with foreign central banks strikes us as a straightforward way to achieve this objective. Such swap lines would ensure that the Federal Reserve could serve as a lender of last resort in foreign currencies for U.S. institutions. In particular, these lines would offer a reliable vehicle for providing foreign-currency funding to U.S. banks during times when U.S. markets were closed because of either time zone differences or U.S. holidays.  Our expectation is that these new swap lines would be signed and implemented only if funding conditions \nclearly warranted. We do not recommend putting them in place on a precautionary \nbasis, largely because we are not certain how the markets would receive the \nannouncement of such facilities.  Rather, the features of these lines could be negotiated with our central bank counterparties, with the draft agreements then put on the shelf to be approved and executed as needed. To ensure that these lines could be rapidly implemented in deteriorating conditions, we recommend that the FOMC consider delegating authority to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to conclude such arrangements.  There might still be \nsome announcement effect created by the reporting of such a vote in the FOMC minutes, but it would probably not be seen as signaling the same urgency as an announcement that the facilities themselves had been established.  The authority granted to the subcommittee in this regard would be symmetric to that already delegated to the subcommittee to negotiate swap arrangements to allow major foreign \ncentral banks to lend dollars. Three further issues are worth mentioning briefly.  First, the legal structure of our existing swap lines requires the Federal Reserve to deposit the foreign currency it \nreceives as part of the swap in an account at the foreign central bank.  These new swap lines would be symmetric to our existing lines, but they would allow the Federal Reserve to lend the foreign currency to U.S. financial institutions and require foreign central banks to deposit the dollars they receive at the Federal Reserve.  In principle, our existing swap arrangements could be amended to allow us to lend foreign currency. But we would prefer implementing these new swap lines through a separate and parallel set of agreements in order to reduce similarities to the old-style swap lines that were used to fund foreign exchange intervention in previous decades.  Second, there are other means that could, in principle, be used to get foreign-currency funding to U.S. institutions under stress. One alternative would be striking agreements with foreign central banks for them to lend against high-quality dollar \ncollateral. But central banks have been working on these procedures for some time, and although progress has been made, not enough of these arrangements are in place \nto address the existing vulnerabilities.  In addition, foreign central banks may be hesitant to lend to a troubled U.S. institution during a period of stress, particularly on the basis of collateral held outside their jurisdictions.  As another approach, we could simply require U.S. institutions to sell their dollar collateral and obtain foreign currency themselves in the foreign exchange spot or forward market.  However, this might be difficult or disruptive during periods of market stress and would leave \n    institutions vulnerable during times when foreign markets are open and U.S. markets are closed. Third, the provision of foreign-currency denominated liquidity to the foreign branch of a U.S. depository institution would rely on the discount window authority of the Reserve Banks, and some technical issues would need to be worked through in implementing a lending arrangement along these lines.   The staff is not proposing that you vote today to establish these new swap arrangements, but we are highlighting this as an issue meriting your attention.  Wealso note that, if stresses in foreign-currency funding conditions persist, we may be back to youperhaps very soon (and perhaps even in the middle of the night)",
    "But I think it would probably be better not to guess.  Maybe Trish wants to guess.",
    "Like the domestic forecast, our outlook for growth in the foreign economies is a little stronger than in the previous Greenbookup about  percentage point on average throughout the forecast period.  We estimate that output abroad contracted sharply in the first quarter of this year, matching the fourth quarters 7 percent drop. We expect real GDP in the second quarter to contract a further 2 percent at an annual ratewhich, although representing some moderation in the pace of decline, would still be the worst quarterly outcome in four decades were it not for the plunges recorded in the two previous quarters.  Our working hypothesis is that foreign growth will gradually rebound, turning slightly positive in the second half of \nthis year before recovering more earnestly next year.  Consistent with this forecast, we believe that some early signs of stabilization around the world are starting to emerge, although the evidence on this score is admittedly mixed. Your international exhibit shows some data that have informed our thinking.  As in the United States, equity prices around the world (the top left panel) have moved up since the time of your last meeting, potentially suggesting that some severe outcomes may now be seen as less likely.  These gains in stock prices were led by a rebound in financial sector equities. More broadly, global financial stress appears to \nhave receded some:  LIBOROIS spreads, CDS premiums, and corporate bonds spreads have all posted declines. The spot price of WTI has risen to around $50 per barrel, up about $7 per barrel since the March Greenbook.  Other commodity prices have also increased, albeit by smaller amounts.  In the case of oil, the rise likely reflects OPECs aggressive production cuts of 3 million barrels a day since September.  But with a broad array of commodity prices showing increases, the rise may also signal a stronger outlook for global demand for commodities. \n       In the advanced foreign economies, the recent news on activity has been mixed.  Industrial production, shown in the middle left panel, has continued to sink, and unemployment rates have moved up more.  The Japanese economy experienced a particularly sharp decline in the first quarter, with GDP plummeting an estimated 18 percent at an annual rate, an even steeper drop than in the fourth quarter.  For other advanced foreign economies, the rate of contraction is estimated to have also steepened in the first quarter, albeit less dramatically.  However, some recent survey data show signs of an incipient slowing in the rate of contraction.  Purchasing \nmanagers indexes and some other surveys have tended to edge up over the last month or two. These surveys remain below 50 and thus indicate further contraction but at a slower pace.  That said, the picture is far from uniform; for example, Japans Tankan survey (not shown) sank in the first quarter to its lowest level on record. In emerging Asia and Latin America, we see a little more evidence that the sharp drop in activity may be letting up.  As in the advanced economies, most purchasing managers index surveys suggest some abating in the rate of contraction, and Chinas PMI indicates that the expansion has resumed.  Many of the sharpest declines in \noutput were in economies that were heavily exposed to the collapse in world trade.  The bottom middle panel shows that exports in some countries have ticked up \nsomewhat or flattened out, although they are still at very low levels.  To varying degrees, industrial production has also bottomed out in China, Korea, Brazil, and Mexico. Perhaps most notably, Chinas GDP release for the first quarter surprised us on the upside, with growth reboundingby our reckoningto roughly 6 percent at \nan annual rate, up from just 1 percent in the fourth quarter.  We see this bounceback as suggesting that the substantial stimulus that the authorities have put in place may be working more quickly than we had anticipated.  But we underscore our standard disclaimers about the reliability of the Chinese data. At the time of the last Greenbook, our decision to write down a forecast that called for the pace of contraction to ease during the second quarter was largely an act of faith. We are now a little more confident in this regard.  In addition to the early glimmers of hope in the data, governments and central banks around the world continue to actively combat the weakness in demand with fiscal and monetary stimulus.  More central banks in the advanced economies have neared the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and others have maintained or expanded their unconventional measures.  Central banks in emerging-market economies have been \nable to lower their policy rates as well.  Moreover, the recent commitment by the G-20 leaders to increase the IMFs lending capacity and the introduction of the \nFunds new flexible credit line appear to have diminished the downside risks facing the emerging-market economies. Based on these developments, the overall tone of our international forecast has notched up from one of unmitigated terror in March to just very deep anxiety at present. Suffice it to say that we still see many risks:  The recent data have been mixedwith those ticking up only having done so for a month or two; financial \n                                                       4 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). market conditions are still fragile; and it remains to be seen whether the macro policy responses that have been put in place will be sufficient to stem the ongoing declines in private spending.  Moreover, the recent outbreak of swine flu poses potentially serious downside risks to economic activity, particularly in Mexico. The global recession is having a profound effect on U.S. trade.  We now estimate that both exports and imports dropped an astonishing annual rate of 31 percent in the first quarter, with imports more than 11 percentage points weaker than projected in March. Together these changes add 1 percentage point to U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter. February imports were held down partly by production disruptions associated with the Lunar New Year in Asia, but West Coast port data for March suggest a rebound. Auto trade, especially imports, should bounce back some  following North American production shutdowns earlier this year.  That said, the ongoing disruptions in the auto sector are likely to generate further fluctuations in trade flows in coming months.  Also, notably, the ISM series for export orders has inched up from its December low. Since the March Greenbook, the broad nominal dollar has fallen roughly 3 percent. This depreciation has come  in response to a number of developments, including the FOMCs March announcement that it would ramp up asset purchases, the smaller-than-expected cut in the ECBs policy rate early this month, and signs of diminished risk aversionwhich have tended to support EME currencies.  Despite this depreciation over the past six weeks or so, the broad dollar is still up more than 2 percent since the end of last year. Going forward, the decline in the dollar and higher foreign growth have raised our projection for exports, and the stronger outlook for the United States has lifted our forecast for imports as well. But even after these upward revisions, the outlook for trade is still quite weak, with exports continuing to contract through the third quarter and import growth remaining soft.  Net exports, after adding a little more than \n percentage point to the change in GDP in the second quarter, are projected to subtract  percentage point on average in the second half of this year and in 2010.  All told, while signs of stabilization might very well be appearing, they do not change our view that the global recovery will most likely be slow and tentative.  In the realm  of green shoots, our forecast is much more like a small potted plant or a vulnerable asparagus garden than a large leafy tree."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I think there is little question that the immediate prospects for the economy are negative.  It is going to contract in this quarter; certainly my guess is the second quarter and possibly into the third.  But in response to your question, I do think there will be beginnings of the recovery in the second half of the year, \n   precisely for the reasons spelled out in yesterdays presentation:  the dynamics of the inventory-adjustment process, a gradual further improvement in financial conditions, the ebbing of weakness in housing activity, and the consequences of stimulative policies, both monetary and fiscal. So I do think that there is a reasonable probabilityI guess this is going to make me the optimist at the tablethat something like the Greenbook forecast is going to be realized over that time frame. I know there is a lot of negative sentiment around right now and a lot of negative rhetoric.  You know, that is part and parcel of a recession.  I am not suggesting that we take a lot of comfort from that, but I do think we should keep it in perspective that it goes with every recession that I have observed.  They can say, Well, this time we really mean it,",

The question everyone seems to be asking is whether, in the parlance of our Chairman, we are now seeing green shoots in economic developments both here and abroad.  Nathan and I thought that we would take a crack at addressing that question this afternoon.  I should note right up front that my track record for spotting green shoots is not inspiring. While in high school, I had a brief job with a lawn service.  One day while I was riding my tractor, a woman came running out her back door gesticulating wildly. It turns out that the patch of unruly weeds I had just mowed down were, in 3 The materials used by Messrs.

The top-line GDP figure that the BEA is currently estimating, minus 6.1 percent, is very close to our estimate of minus 6.3 percent.  As usual, the offsetting errors were our friends.",
    "I would point to two on the domestic spending side.  Personal consumption, as you can see, was stronger than we had estimated2.2 percent versus the 1.1 percent we had projected.  At this point, we will have to see the details to know whether there is any signal that we should take from that.  The other area that I would note is nonresidential structures, which came in at minus 44.2 percent versus the minus 26.4 percent that we were forecasting.  I guess that wont come as much of a surprise to many of you who reported incredible weakness in that area yesterday.  Some of that unexpected weakness came in the drilling and mining activity, so maybe some of those rigs that are making their way from Kansas City to Richmond got lost somewhere along the way.",

However, my colleagues and I want to draw the line at studying planetary alignment, tarot cards, or the entrails of chickens.",
    "Of course, I recognize that at least a few of you probably view consulting the entrails of a chicken and consulting an expectations-augmented Phillips curve to be observationally equivalent",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With the incoming data having been unusually kind to us and changes in conditioning assumptions having only small and largely offsetting effects, the broad contours of the Greenbook forecast have changed very little since September.  As we had anticipated, real GDP turned up last quarter and appears to be on track to expand again in the current quarter.  On average, we project real activity to increase at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second half of this year. Roughly speaking, we expect the economy to expand at a similar pace through most of 2010 before picking up more noticeably in 2011.  The main drivers behind our forecast of continued moderate growth are an accommodative \nmonetary policy, an easing of tight credit conditions, a gradual waning of negative wealth effects, and an accompanying improvement in household and business \nsentiment. While these same factors have been a feature of our forecast since last spring, we now have some tangible evidence of their influence on financial and economic conditions. The stock market has moved well above its earlier lows, house prices appear to have flattened out, bond spreads have come in dramatically, and household and business confidence has rebounded. These improvements have been \n      accompanied by upturns in real GDP, industrial production, and importantly, final sales. In the household sector, consumer spending has been increasing at a moderate pace, even after accounting for the fluctuations induced by the cash-for-clunkers \nprogram, and home sales and housing starts have been trending up.  And in the business sector, equipment spending appears to be stabilizing after declining steeply for a year and a half. Of course, while the overall improvements that have occurred in financial conditions, spending, and production are supportive of our outlook, these developments far from ensure the continued steady gains in output that we are projecting. Indeed, if you view current conditions as inconsistent with the tenor of the recovery that we are projecting, we would agree.  Our forecast is predicated upon a further narrowing of the equity premium, an additional decline in bond spreads, some easing of currently tight credit conditions, and further improvements in household and business sentiment. While, in broad terms, events have been unfolding much as we had expected, there have been some surprises with which we have had to contend.  Once again, the incoming data on spending and production have been somewhat stronger than we expected, whereas the data on employment and hours have been weaker.  As a result, we now estimate that labor productivity increased at an average annual rate of about 5 percent through the first three quarters of this year.  With both our statistical filtering models and the anecdotal reports suggesting that some of these increases will be permanent, we raised our estimate of the level of structural productivity in this \nforecast. Given this higher level of structural productivity, we now think businesses will have less need to increase labor input in order to meet rising product demand.  As a consequence, we postponed the projected bottoming-out of employment until early next year, with noticeable job gains not expected to be evident until the spring.  \nAccordingly, the unemployment rate is now projected to peak above 10 percent in coming months and to recede to 9 percent by the end of next year and to 8 percent in late 2011a path that is about  percentage point above that incorporated in our September Greenbook. Beyond dealing with the crosscurrents in the incoming data, we confronted only small and largely offsetting changes in the major factors conditioning our forecast.  A slightly weaker dollar, somewhat faster growth in foreign activity, and a gradual spur to demand from the higher level of potential output were pluses for projected growth of real GDP. But these favorable influences were more than offset by a weaker stock market and higher oil prices.  On net, we edged down projected growth of real GDP a tenth in both 2010 and 2011to increases of 3.4 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Because the basic contour of the forecast and its rationale are so similar to our previous projection, I thought I would organize the remainder of my remarks around \n      four questions that could be raised about our projection, especially in light of recent developments.  First, are we giving too little signal to the recent strength in the readings on spending and production?  Second, are we giving too much signal to the recent weakness in the data from the labor market?  Third, and in the opposite direction, are we headed for an extended jobless recovery?  And fourth, with fiscal impetus likely to fade and the inventory cycle providing only a transitory lift to production, why are we forecasting a sustained acceleration of activity? Let me start by addressing the question of whether we are reading too little signal into the unexpected strength in the recent data on spending and production.  As you know we revised up again our estimate of the growth of real GDP in the third quarterin this forecast about 1 percentage point, to 3 percent at an annual rate.  But rather than propagating forward any of that impulse to growth, as might be suggested by some models of real GDP, we have actually revised down the growth of real GDP in the current quarter about  percentage point, to an annual rate of 2 percent.  We think that there are a few reasons to believe that the third-quarter GDP figures overstate the underlying pace of the expansion. For one, we are skeptical of the BEAs outsized estimate of the positive contribution of motor vehicle inventories to third-quarter GDP.  In my experience, most folks would rather have bamboo shoots placed under their fingernails than have to sit through an explanation of light truck inventory valuations.",
    "So perhaps this will be a painful introduction for President Kocherlakota to some of the \nmore arcane aspects of the forecast. While models of truck inventories are found infrequently in the American Economic Review, these types of models are a mainstay where most of my important results appear, the Journal of Obscure and Largely Useless Facts.",

    "it does have the advantage of allowing me to endorse a consensus without having to repeat all of the reasoning that has generated it. So let me begin by agreeing with what I hear to be the prevailing view.  First, the pace of decline in the economy has slowed significantly since our last meeting.  Second, since our last meeting, we have seen some encouraging indications in the data, \n    but, Mr. Chairman, I have to say here that the one thing you may regret from your 60 Minutes appearance is the use of this phrase.  Third, there is considerable uncertainty whether these are green shoots promising blossoms to come or a school of red herring swimming across the sea of death.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought someone might ask this, which is why I didnt get in the queue. Brian, what kind of reaction do you expect from markets and economic commentators to the press release the Chairman is working on?  He read us part of the draft on the modifications to the various liquidity facilities.  Specifically, do you think theres much of a chance that it will be read as, if not the beginning of tightening, the lifting up of the screwdriver and placing it against the screw?",
    "Mr. Chairman, I think we should say for the record that Brian should draw no negative inferences from the fact that at his very first meeting President Lacker suggests that we should withdraw discretion from the Desk.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Having exhausted my limited stock of witticisms about coming last in line before the Chairman, I asked Debbie to move me up.",
    "But I also wanted to come a little earlier because, even in the five months since my first FOMC meeting, a lot has changed.  At that time, we were contemplating essentially two scenarios, very bad and even worse. In no small part because of the various actions of the Federal Reserve, the financial system and the economy have largely stabilized, albeit at historically lower levels than we would certainly like to see. It seems very likely now there will be positive, perhaps quite positive, growth in the second half of this year. As for 2010, more upside risk has crept into many peoples forecasts.  So in thinking about our policies going forward, we may be at a point at which it is useful to consider alternative outcomes in a roughly probabilistic fashion and to test how readily we can craft the narrative that leads to each outcome.  It would be a bit quixotic of me to undertake this task for all seven of the Greenbook scenarios to which Larry alluded earlier, so let me distill the manifold possibilities to just three.  One, grind it outa gradual, somewhat halting recovery that leads to 2010 growth somewhere in the vicinity of trend but below what one might expect in a rebound from a severe slump.  Two, relapsea significant stumble for the recovery next year, with GDP growth again dropping significantly below trend.  And, three, rejuvenationa much more robust recovery, with GDP growth significantly exceeding trend, not quite a V-shape perhaps but a reasonably steep slope on the way up. So just to put my cards on the table, I would assign roughly even odds to the first possible outcome, the grind-out scenario.  Not coincidentally, I regard the Greenbook extended baseline to be consistent with this outcome.  Although I am somewhat less optimistic about next year than the staff is, I note that their forecast for the second half of this year is pretty conservative.  So if \n   one averages out their forecast over six quarters, it yields something akin to the first outcome.  Of the remaining two, I see a somewhat greater chance of relapse than of rejuvenation, though I should say that I now regard the odds of the two alternative outcomes as considerably less skewed than I thought as recently as the June meeting.  So clearly I find the story of measured recovery the easiest to tell, in part because the very factors that augur well for the remainder of 2009 may not have sufficient staying power to maintain a healthy pace of recovery through all of next year. The salutary effects of the fiscal stimulus package will start tapering off in the first part of next year. The undoubted need for firms to replenish their inventories will lead to sustained production increases only if consumption increases can themselves be generated and maintained.  The case for a steady increase in personal consumption expenditures is certainly plausible, but it \nis hardly compelling. According to the reported employment cost index, private wages and salaries have been decelerating. With large and still growing slack in labor markets, there is good reason to believe that personal income will continue to suffer from rising unemployment and suppressed wage gains. Moreover, there remains, as Larry mentioned, the important question of what saving rate we will see once incomes do begin to rise again.  The Greenbook makes a reasonable case based on past experience for a 4 percent rate, but the present crisis may contain the seeds of a behavioral shift among some classes of consumers that could move the rate up a percentage point or more. It appears that even the new normalcy in credit availability, both retail and wholesale, may be some way off.  The progress in the corporate bond markets, and to a lesser degree short-term funding markets and plain vanilla securitization markets, has not extended to credit markets more generally. In particular, the rate of decline in bank lending has been accelerating during the \n   spring and summer.  There will doubtless be multiple revisions to the July figures, but the preliminary estimate of a whopping 18 percent decline spread across all forms of lending is a sobering reminder of the difficulties ahead.  While a considerable part of this drop is surely attributable to the decline in demand and cautiousness in underwriting that are typical of recessions, it seems likely that there are also structural factors in both bank lending and credit markets, such as capital impairment and business model challenges, that will weigh on credit markets for some time. I can certainly tell the other two storiesthough with less conviction and, in the interest of time, more briefly.  A relapse could occur if privately generated demand cannot adequately fill in behind the waning effect of fiscal stimulus, given such factors as the expected persistently high levels of unemployment; the potential for more-rapid efforts to repair personal, corporate, and financial balance sheets; and the severe retrenchment of sub-federal government spending that is coming in the next two budget cycles.  If commercial real estate markets turn out to be even moderately worse than currently expectedbad enoughloan losses at many regional and \ncommunity banks could become truly debilitating.   Rejuvenation might come if both confidence and wealth are significantly boosted by a continuation of the equity market rally and a more rapid recovery of housing markets.  The latter of course would also prompt a greater rebound in construction.  Along with the effects of pent-up consumer demand for durables and other items, these developments could provide not just a substitute for fiscal stimulus but a boost beyond the temporary effects of cash-for-clunkers, infrastructure investment, and the various income transfer features of the February legislative package. Global economic recovery, particularly in Asia, may proceed more quickly with an attendant boost to U.S. export growth.  While I can sketch out this more optimistic path, each of \n  its elements seems quite a bit less likely than those supporting the more sluggish outcome and modestly less likely than the catalyst for relapse. I will be interested to hear if some of you can tell this last tale more convincingly.  For the present, though, what I think is most important in my little exercise is that the chances of next year being somewhere between tepid and bad appear to me somewhere north of 75 percent in the absence of further monetary or fiscal policy measures.  Where exactly along that spectrum the actual outcome falls will probably not become much clearer for some time.  If this is a reasonable way of looking at things, our best-advised posture for at least a few more, and maybe more than a few more, meetings may be the somewhat unsatisfactory and awkward one of neither lifting another implement out of our toolbox nor closing the box up and declaring the job finished.

  "MR. WARSH.": [
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Maybe I will start with a note on the political economy before turning to the statement.  I had thought that we would know the situation was improved when the Fed was off the front pages.  I think we have been off the front pages not because the situation has improved but because the Treasury is taking over the front pages, and that is a good thing. So I feel pretty comfortable that we are finding ourselves slowly but surely into this weeks headlines that we are murky and they dont know.  I am not that encouraged, as I think about this statement for us, to try to make news if we dont have it.  The baton has been passed to a new Administration, and we should be cautious about stepping up before we know exactly where they are and before we know where we are.  That is just an instinct, which maybe pervades and suggests a preference for alternative B. \n  With respect to a couple of the items that have been debated on alternative B, Mr. Chairman, I would resist the suggestion that we import the sentence in section 3 of alternative A.  I prefer to keep it as is.  I would rather not, to the point made at the other end of the table, add on additional risk at this point in the public square.  My own sense is that the risks havent changed materially since we last met.  But adding that sentence suggests that somehow we are now acknowledging that they have, and at least to my mind it is not quite there.  Even though sometimes I also have an instinct to make the statement a confessional of sorts, I think it is dangerous for us to do that until the lust is outside our hearts, so to speak.",

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I would talk briefly about the real economy, then financial markets, and then inflation, in that order. On the real economy, in terms of near-term growth and employment prospects, like many of you, I think GDP growth looks shaky through year-end.  The arithmetic of GDP may yield a positive quarter or two, but I see very little evidence that that will be enduring, or at least something that is a strong foundation on which to build.  President Fisher was much chagrined yesterday to park his shiny new car next to what he described as my clunker, and he suggested that I take the government up on its generous $4,500 voucher.

My first instinct was, Boy, we could hedge that perfectly.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me talk about two things with respect to policy: first, the mortgage-backed securities, which have been much discussed, and second, the third paragraph and the suggestions therein.  First, on the MBSno surprise.  Im pleased that were ending and announcing the end of our purchases with respect to both MBS and agency debt.  On the agency debt side, I dont think its likely to be misunderstood or misinterpreted, but back-channel communications there could be constructive.  With respect to the mortgage-backed securities, I think we may well have overstayed and outstayed our welcome, but at least providing clarity that we are at this moment completing our purchases early next year is useful.  It may turn out that rates move even over the intermeeting period, as Brian Sack and Bill Dudley suggested, in anticipation of the end of that program.  I think they are anticipating some move, and from our perspective, its okay. It will be interesting to see what the fiscal and political authorities think about our comfort with that move in thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages and what sorts of responses \n        they either ask of us or ask of themselves there.  As I think we all know, the form and function of the GSEs is likely to get more attention come next year. The exit problems that were talking about with respect to mortgage-backed securities factored into some of our thinking about the purchases after these markets started functioning.  I guess you should add me to the camp of those who are certainly open minded and even forward leaning about thinking about the net benefits of bringing some liquidity and duration back to those markets at the appropriate time, which is not now.  And Mr. Chairman, I think it is at least as important that we dont signal that $1 trillion or $1.25 trillion of MBS are permanently off the market.  I think that is likely to be unconstructive and restricting of our options going forward if markets come to that view.  So not only for our own internal purposes of thinking about it but also given the uncertainties about the mortgage finance market, I think making sure thats one of a number of alternatives that we talk about more publicly at this point would be useful. Turning to policy in the third paragraph, I think that the additions and the including phrase are actually quite useful. They amplify the conditions that underscore our condition-dependent forecast. I noted and giggled like many of you when Brian showed the number of speeches by FOMC members in this intermeeting period, and I guess Id make a couple notes about it.  First, I saw remarkable accord then and, frankly, around this table about the conduct of policy.  I think, with the exception of the President who represents the Game 6 loser of the World Series,",
    "A little extra pressure for your pithy summary of yesterdays discussion.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Four quick points.  First, I support alternative B with the Fisher-Kohn amendment about the reluctance by businesses to add head count.  While Im sympathetic to the views President Lacker described on the incremental net benefits of our MBS purchases, which I have discussed for some time, weve now said that we were going to do it, and theres nothing that weve learned between the last meeting and this meeting that would cause me to say that now is the right time to say, Just kidding.  So I think we should live up to what we said, because it would be, I think, a confusing retrenchment to go back to a smaller purchase level, even though, as a first impression many months ago, I would have been \nsympathetic to that view. Second, I support ending the existing liquidity facilities, and I guess Im of the view that we shouldnt relegate that to a separate statement.  We should make it a virtue.  We put these facilities in place. They did all that we expected them to do and probably more.  Theyve served their purpose. It is time for them to move on, and I think we shouldnt be sheepish about that.  I take that last line as seriously, I think, as President Yellen does.  When we say that were prepared to modify, I dont think thats boilerplate at all.  I think that says were still very attentive to whats going on. So, with respect to TALF or any other facilities, we need to be more aggressive as the financial conditions and economic conditions warrant.  I think were prepared to do so, but I dont think we should shy away from that.   \nThird, on the question about the language around the purchases of securities, Id like to make two points on what President Kocherlakota said.  First, I just like saying that, Kocherlakota."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be delivering remarks this morning that were, for the most part, prepared by Dave Stockton, who cant be with us today, as the Chairman mentioned, because of illness.  I should note that such circumstances may have little historical precedent.  My colleagues and I have now completed an exhaustive search of the National Archives, checking all the criticaloriginal source material, and found no instance in which Robin had to clean up Gotham City on his own because Batman was indisposed; and no mention of Tonto ever having to face mortal peril by himself because the Lone Ranger was back at the ranch recuperating from the latest flu pandemic.  My colleagues in Public Affairs often emphasize the importance of expectations management, so in that spirit, I have set myself the bar of hoping that todays proceedings go better than when Captain Edward Smith asked First Officer Murdoch to take a turn at the helm of the Titanic",
    "Now turning to Daves remarksI am speaking in Daves voice: Id like to do three things this afternoon. First, we have received an unusually large slug of data since the close of the Greenbook, so I will provide a brief update on \nthe near-term forecast. Second, Id like to summarize our take on where we are in the \n    recovery process at present. And finally, I will point out what we see as the major sources of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. Since we published the forecast last Wednesday, we have received readings on retail sales, merchandise trade, inventories, consumer sentiment, industrial production, and producer prices. The retail sales data for November were right in line with our projection. As you know, we had been rather skeptical earlier in the fall when the consumer spending data began to show improvement.  We thought declining employment, weak incomes, sour sentiment, and still tight financial \nconditions should be exerting greater restraint on spending than implied by the incoming data.  However, some of that tension was reduced by the sizable upward \nrevisions that the BEA made to its estimates of labor income in the second and third quarters. Those revisions suggest that the recovery in consumer spending is on a firmer footing.  Last Fridays reading on consumer sentiment from the Reuters/Michigan survey showed a further modest improvement that also is consistent with the pickup in spending that we have witnessed of late.  All told, we \nnow estimate that real PCE increased at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second half, no different from our forecast of last Wednesday, but about  percentage point faster than our October forecast. We also received data on retail inventories late last week.  Retail inventories outside the motor vehicle sector ran off at a slower pace in October than we had expected, adding a couple of tenths to our forecast of growth in real GDP in the current quarter. And the somewhat stronger-than-expected figures for exports in October reported in last weeks release on merchandise trade also added a couple of tenths to current quarter growth.  Nathan will have a bit more to say about that in a few moments.  Taken together, the inventory and trade data would lead us to revise up estimated growth in real GDP in the current quarter to an annual rate of about 4 percent. Earlier today, we published our first estimate of industrial production in November.  Total IP increased an estimated 0.8 percent last month, while manufacturing output rose 1.1 percent.  We pride ourselves on cultivating a high degree of collegiality in the Division of Research and Statistics, so it comes as no surprise to find out that we had built a pretty good forecast of these results into last weeks Greenbook"

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say, first, that I have not been thinking about or discussing these topics since 1995.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I am marginally favoring A with B4 or B with A2 and 3.",
    "Sentence?",
    "Now Im the one standing in the way of dinner.  I just want to talk a bit about expansion of the TALF and then also about asset purchases.  In terms of expanding the TALF, my concern is about some of the asset classes, for instance, commercial-mortgage-backed securities. I dont know a lot about how those are put together, but I do know a lot about commercial mortgages, and theyre much closer to business loans than they are to real estate loans. Theyre entirely dependent on cash flows of different types of businesses.  So if we get into those kinds of purchases and we start to determine the haircuts, were going to be looking at credit allocation, because were going to be looking at differences in conditions in different industries and the real estate that supports those industries. The second thing is that I dont think you can make a bad asset into a good one by taking a larger haircut. If were going to be taking assets not from banks, but from anybody who wants to disgorge them, then what would keep us from simply moving assets from one hedge fund to another? And I really get concerned that the Fed ends up getting stuck trying to digest every hairball thats out there in the marketplace.",
    "Thats a technical term, hairball. I also worry that when we originally talked about expanding the TALF up to $1 trillion, it was with the understanding that that was conditional upon our getting the ability to issue either Fed bills or the supplemental Treasury securities.  That has gotten lost in the discussion of it, and I worry that with a quick announcement on this other facility, the notion would again get lost, namely, that its dependent upon other things happening. Finally, I dont see this as a good bankbad bank situation, and I worry whether wed have enough left to deal with emergencies if they came up.  Ill talk more about this tomorrow, but the more I keep going around and around considering all the things were trying to do to fix the banking systemwhile I think its importantIm not nearly as confident as everyone else \n that its something that we can do. So I keep coming back to thinking that the only thing we can do is to put a floor under house prices.  If we could put a floor under house prices, that would also put a floor under bank losses, and I think its our best chance to get moving in the right direction. Before I move to asset purchases, Id like to start with the story of an elderly wealthy gentleman who had taken a young bride and begun to spend money like crazy.  His friends got very concerned that he was going to go through his entire fortune, and they elected one of their number to go and talk to him about it.  He said, Sam, were really concerned.  We want to make sure that you know that you cant buy love. Sam said, I know you cant buy love, but if you spend enough money, you can buy something that looks so close you can hardly tell the difference.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am actually in favor of the largest amount that we can all agree on. My objective, as I stated yesterday, is to have the biggest effect on housing that we possibly can. In terms of how we explain that, I do like the prime version, because it puts the action first. Having spent more of my time reading the statements than issuing them, it seems to me the first paragraph was always the action paragraph.  And I think for a good time to come this will be our action.  In addition, I think the easier we can make this to report, the better off we are. If you get reporters, particularly third- and fourth-level reporters, on a deadline and all they read is the first part and skim through the rest, they may not necessarily pick up the size of this action. So I have a pretty strong preference for the prime version.  Also, while I find it interesting to put it on a percent-growth basis, weve already started down the path with the dollar amounts, and I think continuing with the way weve been communicating it already has some certainty and some simplicity.  To me it feels like announcing a stock repurchase in the private sector. In that case, you size your stock repurchase in relation to the amount of outstanding shares that you have, and its perceived that way and tends to impact your price that way. Finally, on measuring effectiveness, I think the questions at this point would be:  How big an effect does it have immediately on housing, on the stock market, and on things that create wealth, and how quickly do we see whether or not it has spillover effects? The last piece is this sentence that says we will be assessing whether a faster pace of asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions.  I originally liked that, because it implied that we were willing to do even more.  On thinking about it, though, theres something to be said for creating a little bit of fear in the housing markets that this is a window \n     of opportunity to refinance or purchase. So if it doesnt look like rates may go down further if you wait, then I think thats got some real value.  So I suppose ultimately I come down in favor of A plus.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In looking at the false dawn scenario, I was sobered by the degree to which the Greenbook forecast depends on the reduction in financial sector turmoil.  And I share President Rosengrens concern about the potential destabilization resulting from the announcement of the stress-test results.  I am, similarly, skeptical that government capital would spur any additional lending.  Instead, it seems that lending is going to \nbe constrained by the private capital positions, which will then be evaluated in light of capital \nstandards that have been implied by the stress tests.  I suspect that the most important confidence-building aspect of the stress tests may be actually the degree to which government stands ready to provide absolute support in terms of both capital and liquidity to firms in case there is a destabilizing event. In my talking to the banks that were subject to the stress test and were awaiting their results, they reported that they were surrounded by lawyers and that they had developed communication plans A, B, and C for all of their expected scenarios in terms of the results.  I \nemphasize communication plansno capital plans.  The reason for this is that they simply did \nnot believe that they had any ability to raise private capital alongside government capital, and so that exercise seemed futile.  I was struck by one banker to whom I talked who went on at length about his preparations for his stress-test results, to the point that, when I hung up, I went back and checked and determined that, no, he was not covered by the stress test.",
    "So I called him back and said, You know you are not covered by this.  And he said, I know, but we will be. He was absolutely convinced and had been encouraged in that belief by his \nregulators. I did talk to one who was not going to need additional capital, who was getting a strong amount of interest from private equity to repay his government capital but felt as though he would really prefer to wait about six months to separate the stress-test results from the original TARP capital injections.  Also, there were some concerns as to what might unfold in the next six months. I dont think that is unique to him.  I think that a number of companies, although they may have talked about wanting to get out of the original capital, are going to be a little less anxious than they might appear.  One bank that did give back the TARP capital has seen no improvement in its stock price and no discernible improvement anywhere else.  However, I heard from a smaller bank that did give back the capital, and the contact reported much rejoicing in his community, a surge in new customers, and congratulations all around.  But the scariest part is that his mother cried in joy and pride when he returned his government capital.  I swear.",
    "The amount of uncertainty about the rules and the changing of the rules are certainly limiting the effectiveness of the TARP, the TLGP, and the PPIP.  A number of firms reported that they were trying to work down their government funding but that private funding is still scarce, and no matter who their primary regulator is right now, they are dealing with multiple \nregulators for multiple programs, all with differing priorities and requirementsthe FDIC for the TLGP, the Fed for the TAF, and the Treasury for the TARP.  They also said that they cant rely on traditional correspondents.  They have been jerked around by the Home Loan Banks.  As one bank put it, at least the Fed wont redline Michigan.",
    "Thank you. On the question of extensions and modifications on liquidity facilities, Im generally in favor of the proposal, but I wonder if one option might be to raise the minimum rate for TAF at the same time we increase the spread on the primary credit, so that wed be treating the two different types of borrowers the same way. On the exit strategies, it strikes me that the whole discussion is incredibly similar to a normal exercise in asset-liability management that goes on in banks all the time and that we should probably be paying attention to the same kind of tools that are used in banks to simulate various possibilities. Regarding these tools, I dont think theyre mutually exclusive, so some modeling of an optimum mixa funding mix if you willof all of the various tools, taking into account some of the different barriers that we might run into in different markets, might make some sense. \n    Also, Id be interested in some sort of regular reporting, whether it is in Notes or the Bluebook or one of the other books, so that we keep an eye on the potential costs of the exit strategies in a number of different environments.  As a banker, I have been in a situation where I have looked into the future and have seen losses that would arise from unwinding positions that I had taken. Of course, at that time, I was never able to adjust my cost of funds absolutely.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The banks have settled down a little bit since the stress test. They report the stress tests were not all that terrible, and they were as surprised as I was at the ease of the capital raise.  Theyre looking for opportunities now to raise debt.  Theres no trust preferred available, and a couple were issuing investment units; one had a common equity and a convertible bond component, and another reported having to add warrants to debt in order to attract investors. \n   All would like to pay back the TARP, and theyre divided into those who most likely will not be able to soon and those who can. For those who will not soon, theyre not sure that theyre out of the woods, and they acknowledge that they wouldnt survive being wrong.  Those who have or will soon pay back cite worries about losing their top revenue producers, the cost of the government capital, the fact that new investors who are providing capital want them to get out, andprobably the most honest responseBecause everybody else is getting out. In terms of liquidity, they are moving down to or up to 100 percent loan-deposit ratios those with higher ratios are shedding credit and those with lower ratios are the beneficiaries of that. Deposits are still growing, but at a much slower rate, and, interestingly, in discussing their \nliquidity, they all pointed to their excess funds on deposit with the Federal Reserve.  So, again, I dont see any indication that bankers are concerned about excess reserves right now.  In fact, they think theyre creating them. In terms of profitability, margins are finally improving.  Reserves are still growing. Expenses are down except for FDIC assessments. Fee income is flat.  Mortgage income was huge in the first two quarters, but refinance activity, in particular, has slowed dramatically with the higher rates. In terms of credit management, the long process of working through residential problems continues. Construction lending has plateaued or a little bit better.  OREO properties are moving, although there are still problem areas, such as lots in Arizona and condos in Florida.  C&I is actually holding up. A few banks mention noticeable problems with small businesses and \nsaid that mom-and-pop stores are simply giving up.  Their classifications are growing as the financial statements come in and show the expected lower profitability, but theyre still not showing up in delinquencies. In terms of commercial real estate, its getting worse, but it still \n    seems manageable.  The bottom is not falling out.  Loans are classified, but not yet charging off. In terms of office buildings, as the leases renew, rents are being negotiated down, and one banker who had just worked through his residential construction was dismayed to find that the offices he had financed were full of real estate companies.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I start, Id like to go back to the question I missed yesterday, which was on the accounting.  I did find out that we actually take exception to GAAP with the evaluation of the SOMA portfolio on the rationale that our purchases and sales are driven by monetary policy considerations rather than valuation.  As we go forward with the MBS purchases, this rationale could get pretty stressed, especially if we choose the securities that we sell for their valuation rather than for some monetary policy reason.  I point that out just so that were aware that the accounting issues we face may ultimately have some political costs, at least when we start to exit, so we cant entirely ignore the losses in those securities. Turning to observations from the banking sector, most of the banks report little change in their current or expected condition since the last meeting.  In terms of new lending, theres very low demand across the board, but pricing is still significantly better.  I asked Why is it with very \n  low demand that your pricing is still so strong?  They said theyre only lending to the highest-quality credits with relationships, with profitability, and borrowers are actually happy to have the lending relationships intact.  Theres very little shopping and very little competition banks arent chasing someone elses customers and customers arent looking for a new bank.  Line usage is at historic lows, even by the borrowers who already have approved credit at very favorable pricing, and borrowers whose banks have closed or been acquired are actually orphaned and unable to get the best terms. Ive been trying to understand the difference between the credit availability in this cycle and the one that followed the last banking crisis. The staff used the flow of funds data to try to estimate the difference between forecast and actual levels of credit and found that at this point in the cycle about 46 percent of the difference can be explained by credit factors rather than economic factors, compared to 62 percent in the 199091 cycle. In terms of loan quality, interestingly, one member of the FAC noted that, when they met here a week or two ago, they had dinner with the Chairman and not one of the bankers had an outlook as positive as the Chairman expressed.  They were quite amazed at the Chairmans \ncheerfulness.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  None of the bankers that I talked with were particularly optimistic, but as I went back and looked at all of the responses together, I was actually a bit more optimistic."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you noted, we all agree that the outlook for economic growth is bleak.  To be sure, our policy actions so far have been aggressive; but even so, I have a predisposition to provide further monetary stimulus.  From a risk-management perspective, there are very few scenarios I can think of that would suggest that further monetary stimulus would be a mistake.  But despite my bias for action, I am hesitant about how to proceed. As I was putting my thoughts together for this portion of the meeting, I recalled the many conversations that we have had around this table about our communication policy.  Even when \nwe were operating in a well-defined policy regime, we often experienced great difficulty in determining how best to express our decision and our intentions publicly.  Now we are operating in a new policy regimecredit easingthat we understand conceptually but for which no operational handbook yet exists. We dont know how to write down the policy rule for this environment, and we surely dont have any empirical estimates to guide our decisions.  Our discussion yesterday about what the effect is of a $250 billion purchase of MBS or a $250 billion purchase of longer-term Treasury securities demonstrates that we just do not have certainty around the effects of those actions.  Before this crisis began, the public had a fairly good grasp of our policy rule. Now they are trying to find the new rule, and I hope they do not find one before we figure out exactly what it is."

    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are in the midst of a very deep and protracted downturn, and I have to squint really hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel.  It is a sad commentary that the one glimmer of light during this intermeeting period has been that economic developments have been roughly in line with our expectations.  In other words, we were braced for the bad news we received. For example, we had expected a dreadful holiday \nretail season, and that is precisely what we got.  One of my directors, the head of a national department store chain, reported that his company posted its worst season since it was founded in 1901. We had anticipated severe hemorrhaging in jobs and a sizable jump in the unemployment rate, and that, too, is what we got.  Many of my business contacts are reporting layoffs and wage freezes. One unpleasant surprise among the economic data was last weeks 15 percent drop in housing starts. The residential housing sector has now shrunk so much that the only real assurance that it will ever stabilize seems to be the fact that construction spending cannot go negative. This is just about the only zero lower bound that is working on our side.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic and financial news has been grim.  Things are now so bad that I actually open the Greenbook with greater trepidation than my 401(k).",
    "The awful employment and spending data have not been much of a surprise, but they do dispel remaining hopes that we might see a turnaround any time soon.  This conclusion is reinforced by what Im hearing from my business contacts.  Their already sour mood is taking another sharp turn for the worse.  One director reported that businesses were so \nshaken that it would take a sustained period of positive data, on the order of six to nine months, before they would begin to consider expanding production and employment.  Another disturbing sign of how tough things are getting is that people appear to be breaking into their piggybanks to make ends meetthe Cash Product Office reports huge increases in the amount of coins being brought into our inventory.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Winston Churchill once remarked that nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.",
    "Well, exhilaration may be an exaggeration, but I am at least hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived a near-death experience. And I am optimistic that you will not be the Chairman who presided over the second Great Depression."
